                  <note>The first edition of this work began publication in 1684, when a volume in Italian entitled "L'esploratore Turco" and a French version entitled "L'esplou du grand seigneur" were published in Paris by C. Barbin. Authorship is disputed, but it is generally agreed that the first fifty letters (the original four volumes) were written by Marana. In the English editions, v. 1 contains the substance of the letters commonly ascribed to Marana. The continuation (i.e. v. 2-8), said to have appeared first in English, has been variously ascribed to Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw ; Bradshaw has also been attributed as the translator (from Marana's Italian manuscripts) of the entire work under Dr. Midgley's editorship. cf. DNB; also Gentleman's magazine, 1841, p. 270.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>PRefaces,</hi> methinks, are ſo much like the <hi>Printed Bills,</hi> paſted upon the <hi>Booths</hi> in <hi>Bartholomew-Fair,</hi> to give an Account of the Entertainment you are to expect within; that, were it not in Pure Complyance with Cuſtom, one would forſwear writing any. But the World is humorous, and muſt be ſerved accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its own Faſhion. Every Thing's damn'd, that is not <hi>à la Mode.</hi> And he that publiſhes a <hi>Book,</hi> without Civilly accoſting the <hi>Reader</hi> at the Beginning, is thought to entrench upon Good Manners.</p>
            <p>To prevent all theſe Inconveniences, 'tis thought fit once more to ſay a Word or Two; not in Praiſe of this <hi>Volume</hi> of <hi>Letters,</hi> (e'en let it take its Fortune as the other <hi>Four</hi> have done) but by Way of <hi>Apology</hi> for ſome Things which may ſeem liable to Cenſure.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps will be offended at the
<pb facs="tcp:102963:4"/>Zeal which appears in this <hi>Arabian,</hi> when he writes in Honour of the <hi>Mahometan Faith.</hi> Others will as much wonder at his Looſneſs and Indifference, his Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of all Things: For, in ſome of his <hi>Letters,</hi> he appears a Great <hi>Sceptick,</hi> and confeſſes himſelf ſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe Gentlemen ought to conſider, that his Style and Sentiments, are ſuited to the <hi>Quality</hi> of the <hi>Perſon</hi> to whom he writes. To his Intimate Friends, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſoms himſelf with Abundance of Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But when he addreſſes to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> or other <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> he is Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Reſerved.</p>
            <p>It may be ſuppos'd, that he underſtood himſelf very well, or elſe he was not fit for that <hi>Employment</hi> in <hi>Paris.</hi> And, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doubt, having had his Education in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> as he profeſſes, he was no Stranger to the <hi>Punctilio's</hi> of Addreſs us'd in the <hi>Turkiſh Court.</hi> It was his Policy and Intereſt, to appear a very Devout <hi>Mahometan,</hi> when he wrote to the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of <hi>State:</hi> And 'tis poſſible, he was ſo in Reality, or at leaſt perſuaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo at certain Seaſons. And yet this hinders not, but he might at other Times take the Liberty to deſcant on ſome Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities in their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102963:4"/>when he wrote to his Familiars, and was minded to converſe with Freedom.</p>
            <p>If in ſome Points, he ſeems to give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to the <hi>Arabian Writers,</hi> who have treated of <hi>Egypt</hi> and its <hi>Antiquities;</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he ſhews himſelf a Man not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fond of <hi>Fables</hi> and <hi>Romances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, let his <hi>Opinions</hi> be what they will, and his <hi>Sentiments</hi> never ſo <hi>Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> in Matters of <hi>Speculation</hi> and <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy;</hi> ſo long as his <hi>Morals</hi> are ſound and good, there's no Occaſion to be Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. We need not fear that any <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> or any Man of Sence will be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted by his Letters, to a <hi>Religion</hi> which he himſelf, tho' profeſſing it, yet ſo often doubts of, and ridicules.</p>
            <p>He ſpeaks very Honourably of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Impartially of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> accuſing their <hi>Vices</hi> rather than their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and appearing all along a Moderate Man in his Sentiments of <hi>Religion,</hi> and a Friend to <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> If he diſcovers ſome Failings, in being too Melancholy; conſider, that he was a Mortal like other Men. However, <hi>Reader,</hi> admire his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted Loyalty, and Imitate it.</p>
            <p>You will find in this <hi>Volume,</hi> True <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi> with Variety of Solid Remarks. And not a few Secrets of <hi>Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102963:5"/>and <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> Uncabineted. Particularly, that Famous <hi>Intrigue</hi> carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by <hi>Colonel Spintelet</hi> and his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, to ſave <hi>Oſtend</hi> from being ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by the <hi>French</hi> in the Year 1658, and to bubble Two of the Ableſt <hi>Stateſmen</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, aſſure thy ſelf, that the next <hi>Volume</hi> will contain more Illuſtrious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, than any that has gone before. Where you will hear of an End put to the <hi>War</hi> between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> after it had laſted Five and Twenty Years; and the Marriage of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. with the <hi>Spaniſh Infanta;</hi> as alſo of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>Peace</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> The <hi>Reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> II. to his <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> after <hi>Twelve</hi> Years <hi>Exile</hi> in <hi>Foreign Countries,</hi> and <hi>Twelve</hi> ſeveral <hi>Revolutions</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> here at <hi>Home.</hi> With many other Memorable and Important Events and Tranſactions in the World: As the dreadful <hi>Earthquake</hi> which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Part of the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> Mountains; the more Deſtructive <hi>Plague</hi> which ſwept away almoſt a <hi>Hundred Thouſand</hi> People in <hi>London;</hi> and the Deplorable <hi>Fire</hi> which conſumed the Greateſt Part of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>City,</hi> in the Space of <hi>Three</hi> Days.</p>
            <p>You will there alſo find an Account of
<pb facs="tcp:102963:5"/>the <hi>Death</hi> of that Great <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State, Cardinal Mazarini:</hi> Of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,</hi> Uncle to the <hi>French King:</hi> Of the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Savoy:</hi> Of <hi>Carolus Joſephus,</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Brother: Of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Vendome:</hi> Of the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> and of <hi>Philip</hi> IV. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons of <hi>Princely Quality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this <hi>Arabian</hi> was Careful to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the <hi>Ottoman Port,</hi> Intelligence of all Things which were moſt Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in <hi>Europe.</hi> And that his <hi>Letters</hi> might not ſeem Tedious, he intermix'd <hi>Moral</hi> Reflections, with ſome <hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>Policy, Eſſays</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and now and then a Touch of <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> And if we may gueſs at the Cauſe of his more abounding in theſe Kind of <hi>Miſcellany</hi> Diſcourſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Year 1659, than he did before: It ſeems probable, that a <hi>General Peace</hi> about that Time being eſtabliſhed in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> he had little elſe to write, but his Obſervations on the ſeveral <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> the Different <hi>Manners, Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>People;</hi> the <hi>Counſels</hi> and <hi>Intrigues</hi> of <hi>Stateſmen:</hi> With ſuch other Matters as occurred worthy of Notice.</p>
            <p>If either in this <hi>Volume,</hi> or in thoſe that are to come, he ſeems in any of his
<pb facs="tcp:102963:6"/>
               <hi>Letters</hi> to alter his Opinion, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his Former Sentiments; remember, 'tis no more than what the Greateſt <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> have done, who have lived to Old Age, as this <hi>Agent</hi> did. No Body is Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s <hi>Retractations,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi>'s <hi>Vanity</hi> of <hi>Sciences;</hi> wherein thoſe Two Great <hi>Authors</hi> run counter to all that they had writ before.

                  <head>Mahmut <hi>the</hi> Arabian, <hi>and Vileſt of the</hi> Grand Signior<hi>'s Slaves, to the Myſterious</hi> Eſad, <hi>Arbitrator of Doubtful Problems,</hi> Prince <hi>of the</hi> Mufti's.</head>
                  <p>WHEN I firſt came to <hi>Paris,</hi> my <hi>Inſtructions</hi> were not ſo Full and Particular, as to direct me in all Emergencies. A great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Things were left to my own Conduct and Prudence, both in <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102963:14"/>So that if I have made any falſe Steps, I hope 'twill be Excuſable; in Regard, 'tis not ſo much my Fault, as that of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> who reſide at the <hi>Auguſt Port.</hi> I have often addreſs'd to them, deſiring Supplemental Rules and Cautions in ſome Peculiar Caſes which I propos'd: But they have been very ſparing of their Counſels. 'Tis true indeed, about Five Years ago, I receiv'd ſome Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Orders from the then <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> and the <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> as alſo from thy <hi>Sanctity:</hi> Wherein I was commanded to write with all Freedom to the <hi>Grandees.</hi> This, with the other Directions, has been of great Uſe to me. It has arm'd me with freſh Courage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd the Melancholy Apprehenſions I had of ſome Mens Revenge, whoſe Vices I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd. Praiſe be to <hi>God, King</hi> of the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> I have accus'd no Man wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Yet I was full of Fears, even in the Performance of my Duty: Knowing, that Mortals Generally love to have their Faults Conceal'd, and purſue thoſe with Malice, who diſcover or reprehend 'em. But now, all my Fears in that Kind are vaniſh'd. Yet, I have Scruples of another Nature, which none but the <hi>Infallible Guide</hi> of the <hi>Faithful</hi> can diſperſe.</p>
                  <p>Ever ſince I have reſided here, I have been preciſe in obſerving all the <hi>Precepts</hi> of our <hi>Holy Law,</hi> ſo far as conſiſted with the Security and Succeſs of my <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> For, I have been forc'd to leap over many Lyes and Falſe Oaths, to conceal my ſelf. I have likewiſe done A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of other Irregular Things, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102963:14"/>the <hi>Cauſe</hi> I am engag'd in. For all which, thou haſt vouchſaf'd me a <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> There remains One Thing, in which thy Advice is Neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>I have been hitherto Punctual in keeping the <hi>Faſt</hi> of <hi>Ramezan,</hi> at the Time appointed to all <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> Which, thou knoweſt, falls Earlier by Eleven Days every Year, than it did the Year before. So that in the Space of Four and Thirty Years, it paſſes through all the Four <hi>Seaſons.</hi> Now this Succeſſive Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of the <hi>Great Faſt,</hi> cauſing it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to fall at the very Times of the moſt ſolemn <hi>Feſtivals</hi> among the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> ſuch as that which they call their <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> which is a <hi>Feaſt</hi> of Thirteen Days; I fear leſt I may be taken Notice of, ſhould I, by Celebrating the <hi>Ramezan</hi> at thoſe Times, contradict the Univerſal Practice of all the <hi>Franks,</hi> and ſtart Suſpicions in thoſe with whom I converſe, to my Diſadvantage and Ruine.</p>
                  <p>To thee therefore, who art the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> of the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> I fly for Counſel in this Exigency: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching thee, to dictate plainly what I am to do.</p>
                  <p>I know, that the Sick, or Wounded, or Travellers, are Diſpens'd with, if they Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the <hi>Sacred Moon.</hi> At which Time, the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> are Open'd, and Inviſible Favours are done to the Devout Obſervers of this <hi>Precept:</hi> Whilſt the <hi>Avenues</hi> of <hi>Heli</hi> are barricado'd, and all the <hi>Devils</hi> Chain'd up from appearing abroad, or doing any Miſchief in the <hi>World.</hi> I ſay, I am not Ignorant of the <hi>Indulgence</hi> which is given to Men under ſuch
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102963:15"/>Circumſtances; provided they ſatisfy the <hi>Law,</hi> by keeping the <hi>Faſt</hi> at ſome other Seaſon, more agreeable to their Health, or other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. And thus far I cou'd have ſilenc'd the Alarms of my own Conſcience, without moleſting thee: Knowing, that a <hi>Muſſulman</hi> is always allow'd this Liberty in a <hi>Foreign</hi> Country, much more in a <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that which I aim at, is to be inform'd, Whether, to put the better Diſguize upon my ſelf, and more efficaciouſly to proſecute the Intereſt of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> I may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Celebrate this <hi>Faſt,</hi> at the preciſe Time that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> keep their <hi>Lent?</hi> For then I ſhould paſs unſuſpected, and no Man wou'd take me for any other, than a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Catholick.</hi> Nay, my Manner of Daily Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting at that Time, wou'd raiſe me a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Credit among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that know me. They wou'd cry me up for a <hi>Saint,</hi> or a very <hi>Holy</hi> Man. For, the <hi>Faſt</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> in Compariſon with the <hi>Rigorous Abſtinence</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> Thoſe indeed refrain all Sorts of <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but they load their Tables with Variety of <hi>Fiſh</hi> and other Dainties; neither have they Patience to tarry for their Repaſt beyond the Mid-Day. Whereas, the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans</hi> taſte of Nothing during the <hi>Ramezan,</hi> till the <hi>Sun</hi> is gone down, and the <hi>Stars</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. No, not even in the parching <hi>Deſarts</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where Men are ready to periſh of Thirſt. Yet no Man will extend his Hand to the Water-Pot, to refreſh himſelf in thoſe Unſpeakable Agonies, till the Shadow of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102963:15"/>
                     <hi>Earth,</hi> is advanc'd into the <hi>Higher Region</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> and has baniſh'd the leaſt Glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Sun.</hi> When therefore the <hi>Franks</hi> ſhall ſee me Faſt after this Auſtere Faſhion in their <hi>Lent,</hi> they will ſay, I am a very Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify'd Man, and a Devout <hi>Catholick:</hi> For, they judge altogether by the Out-ſide. So, if any Danger ſhould threaten me, I ſhould find Friends among the <hi>Zealots:</hi> And the <hi>Indifferent,</hi> wou'd not appear my Enemies: But the <hi>Wicked,</hi> whoſe Black Guilt has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred 'em a Terror to themſelves, as well as an Abomination to others, wou'd ſtand in fear of me. Thus, on all Hands, a Way wou'd be open for me, to eſcape a Diſcovery of the <hi>Secrets</hi> committed to my Charge.</p>
                  <p>'Twould be much more to my Satisfaction, if I cou'd with Safety Celebrate this <hi>Faſt,</hi> in the very <hi>Moon</hi> wherein the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was brought down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> as all Good <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> Generally do. But I am taught, not to betray, or ſo much as hazard the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi> of my <hi>Great Maſter,</hi> for a mere <hi>Nicety</hi> or <hi>Punctilio</hi> of <hi>Religion. God</hi> is the <hi>Merciful</hi> of the <hi>Merciful.</hi> And it is his <hi>Will,</hi> that the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>True Faithful,</hi> ſhou'd be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended where-ever the <hi>Moon</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhine on <hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great <hi>Oracle</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmans, Doctor</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Verity,</hi> it is in thy Power to confirm or ſhake my Reſolution in this Point. For, from thy <hi>Sentence,</hi> there is no <hi>Appeal.</hi>

                     <hi>To</hi> Nathan Ben Saddi, <hi>a</hi> Jew <hi>at</hi> Vienna.</head>
                  <p>THou Informeſt me, that the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> is dead, and that divers <hi>Prodigies</hi> happen'd about the Time of his Expiring. Whilſt others report, That the <hi>German Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> himſelf died the 9th. of the laſt <hi>Moon.</hi> However, I ſhall tranſmit thy Advice to the <hi>Shining Port;</hi> not truſting to the Uncertain Intelligence of Fame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperours</hi> muſt reſign up their Breath, as well as Other Mortals. 'Tis a <hi>Tribute</hi> we all owe to <hi>Nature,</hi> who will be paid, one Time or other. Neither has ſhe ever exempted any from the <hi>Common Lot,</hi> ſave <hi>Enoch, Elias,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Theſe were <hi>Holy Prophets,</hi> Perfect <hi>Saints,</hi> and void of <hi>Original Sin;</hi> and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd an Indulgence. Tho' thoſe of your <hi>Nation,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> believe, That the laſt of theſe Three died on a <hi>Croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for all others, they have either been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd by Sickneſs, or ſnatch'd away by ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Death: Some by an <hi>Inviſible Dart</hi> from <hi>Heaven;</hi> Others by the Ruder Hand of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals like themſelves; Millions by the Sword and Spear, and Ten Millions by the ſwifter and more Unavoidable Stroke of the Arrow
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102963:16"/>and Bullet. Whilſt not a few have receiv'd their <hi>Death,</hi> from the very <hi>Elements</hi> which ſupported their <hi>Life.</hi> An Unruly <hi>Fire</hi> has crumbled ſome into their Firſt <hi>Atomes,</hi> and mingl'd their Aſhes with thoſe of their Houſes and Beds of Repoſe: Whilſt <hi>Water,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Principle,</hi> has quench'd the <hi>Vital</hi> Flame in others. There is but <hi>One Way</hi> to enter into this <hi>Life;</hi> but the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Inviſible State,</hi> are without <hi>Number.</hi> And the Greateſt <hi>Monarch</hi> may as well fall by the Prick of a Thorn, as by the Edge of a Sword. Every Time I ſwallow my Meat, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Fate of him who was choak'd by a <hi>Grain</hi> of <hi>Pepper;</hi> And that of <hi>Anacreon</hi> the <hi>Poet,</hi> who was ſtrangl'd by the <hi>Stone</hi> of a <hi>Raiſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I am not ſolicitous in Chuſing or Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Particular</hi> Deaths; knowing, that no Human Counſel, can prevent the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny.</hi> It rather pleaſes me to think (ſuch is my Ambition) that by whatſoever Method I am ſent to the <hi>Grave,</hi> there I ſhall be Equal to the <hi>Alexanders, Caeſars, Timurlengs,</hi> and the Greateſt Mortals. For there is no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>Noble</hi> and <hi>Vulgar,</hi> in that <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> where all ranks are levell'd in the Duſt: As <hi>Diogenes</hi> told <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> when the <hi>Monarch,</hi> beholding that <hi>Philoſopher</hi> in a <hi>Charnel-Houſe,</hi> his Eyes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively fix'd on the Bones of the <hi>Dead</hi> which lay in Heaps, ask'd him, What he was doing? To whom <hi>Diogenes</hi> reply'd, <hi>I am looking for thy Father</hi> Philip<hi>'s Bones, but cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102963:17"/>'em from thoſe of his</hi> Slaves. Some ſuch Thought as this, might perhaps firſt occaſion the Cuſtom of writing <hi>Epitaphs</hi> on the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers</hi> of Eminent Perſons. Among which I have read ſome made by the Entomb'd themſelves, whilſt they were on this ſide the <hi>Grave;</hi> and for their ſingular Phancy, were thought worthy to be Recorded by <hi>Hiſtorians.</hi> Such as this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Sabbas <hi>of</hi> Milan, <hi>by Blood a</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilian, <hi>Friar and Knight of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>wiſh a happy Reſurrection to my Aſhes. While I was alive among Mortals, a little ſatisfy'd me. Now I am dead, and alone in my Grave, I am content with leſs. I neither knew my ſelf, what I was; nor do thou enquire. Traveller, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, if thou be Pious, pray for me, and paſs on. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and live mindful of Death. Living, I provided this Epitaph, knowing I muſt die:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Birth and Life of Mortals, are nothing but Toil and Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:102963:17"/>
                  <p>Such another was that of <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> a <hi>Moor;</hi> who caus'd himſelf to be Bury'd near to the <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Hercules,</hi> with this <hi>Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on his <hi>Tomb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Heliodorus, <hi>a Mad</hi> Carthaginian, <hi>have commanded by my laſt Will and Teſtament, that I ſhou'd be Interr'd here in this Fartheſt Angle of the World: To make Experiment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Man more Mad than my ſelf, wou'd travel thus far to viſit my Sepulcher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that which <hi>Semiramis</hi> caus'd to be Inſcrib'd on her <hi>Tomb,</hi> was a perfect <hi>Satyr</hi> on the <hi>Living.</hi> It was this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> Semiramis, <hi>whilſt Living never was in need of Money; yet was always Compaſſionate to the Poor. Now I'm Dead, my Grave is my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. If any of Royal Race be in Want, let him open this Dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and he ſhall find a Supply.</hi>

                  <p>When <hi>Darius</hi> Conquer'd <hi>Babylon,</hi> and was told of this <hi>Epitaph;</hi> ſtung with Avarice, he caus'd the <hi>Sepulcher</hi> to be open'd, in his own Preſence. But inſtead of Money, they only found a <hi>Tablet</hi> of <hi>Braſs,</hi> with theſe Words Engraven on it:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Epitaph is a Riddle. This is the Interpretation. I never was Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous; onely ſuch are Poor, theſe I pity; and have therefore provided this Leſſon as a Treaſure, for the Man who for Lucre ſhall preſume to violate my Tomb:</hi>

                     <hi>If thou wilt Rob the Living, forbear to Plunder the Dead; leſt they bring thee to Shame, as I have done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou telleſt me, that the <hi>Emperour</hi> ſeems not to be much griev'd for the Death of his Son, the <hi>Roman</hi> King. Perhaps his Sorrow is ſo great, that it cannot find a Vent. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Uncommon Paſſions, are apt to ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within the Heart, whilſt only ſmaller Griefs break forth in Tears.</p>
                  <p>It was a Memorable Saying of a certain <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who was overcome by <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:102963:18"/>the <hi>Perſian Monarch,</hi> and taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with all his Children; When the Cruel <hi>Conquerour,</hi> to ſport himſelf in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of his <hi>Royal</hi> Priſoners, and inſult o'er the Vanquiſh'd <hi>Egyptians,</hi> firſt caus'd the <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the <hi>Captive King,</hi> to be employ'd in the Meaneſt Offices with the Common <hi>Slaves,</hi> before her Father's Face: Then his <hi>Son</hi> to be bridl'd, and curb'd like a Horſe, with a vaſt Burden ty'd on his Back. At both which diſmal Spectacles, the Poor <hi>Egyptian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> ſhed not one Tear: But when he ſaw one that had formerly been his Servant, reduc'd to great Poverty, he wept bitterly. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi> aking him the Reaſon, Why he ſeem'd ſo Inſenſible of his Childrens Calamity, and yet was touch'd with ſo tender a Grief for the Misfortune of a Stranger? He anſwer'd, <hi>Son of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>the Deſolation of my Family afflicts me with ſo profound a Sorrow, that no Tears can expreſs it: But my Compaſſion to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs'd Servant, being not ſo Violent, eaſily breaks forth in Tears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nathan,</hi> I wiſh thee neither Extreme Joy nor Grief; for they are both hurtful to the Heart.</p>

                  <p>WHen I contemplate thy Life ſo full of Innocence, and void of the very Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Vice, I am like a <hi>Serpent</hi> rowz'd from his Sleep, by a Breeze of Cooler Wind, or the Noiſe of a Traveller on the Road. My <hi>Soul</hi> ſtarts; and unfolding all the drowzy Curls of Senſuality, ſtretches it ſelf at full Length. Surpriz'd and aſham'd of its own Lethargy, it ſwiftly retires into any dark Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to cover it ſelf from the Light of its own Faculties, and from the brighter Reflections of thy Spirit, which penetrate like the Beams of the Sun.</p>
                  <p>I do not preſently curſe my ſelf, the Hour of my Nativity, my Friends that have flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd me into an Erroneous Belief of my own Vertue, or my Enemies that have provok'd me, and by various Trains entangl'd me in the Paths of Vice. Such <hi>Malediction,</hi> onely becomes the Mouth of a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Libertine:</hi> For, we arrive at <hi>Perfection,</hi> not by Curſing the <hi>Evil,</hi> but by Imitating the <hi>Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I rather bleſs the Hour of <hi>Conjunction,</hi> the <hi>Influence</hi> of my <hi>better Stars,</hi> and the <hi>Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of a more <hi>propitious Horoſcope;</hi> The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>Praiſe be to <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt:</hi> Peace to the <hi>Angels</hi> who ſtand round his <hi>Throne,</hi> and to the <hi>Prophets</hi> who rejoice in his Preſence.

                  </p>
                  <p>I am raviſh'd and full of <hi>Ecſtaſies,</hi> becauſe there is not found thy Equal on this Side the Clouds. When thou ſhalt be cropt from the Earth, the Mirrour of Mortals, the Flow'r of Human Nature is gone. The Trees of the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> will lament thy Death, by whoſe Preſence they flouriſh'd, and brought forth their Fruit in due Seaſon. At thy Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Graſs of the Field will fade and wither, conſcious that thy Merits drew down the Rain and Dew of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to render <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia</hi> fertile in Herbage.</p>
                  <p>The Beaſts will Languiſh for want of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and Men will bewail the Dearth of the Land; knowing, that the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Juſt,</hi> cauſes the <hi>Ground</hi> to produce a <hi>Plenteous Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But no Mourning will be like that of <hi>Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut,</hi> who can boaſt of thy particular Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;

                  <p>Therefore, as oft as I turn my Face to the City Sanctified by the <hi>Birth</hi> of our <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> I ſend up Vows to <hi>Heaven</hi> for thy Long Life; beſeeching <hi>God,</hi> for the Univerſal Good of <hi>Nature,</hi> to continue the Man on Earth, the <hi>Veſtment</hi> of whoſe <hi>Soul,</hi> is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Rays</hi> darted from all the <hi>Fortunate Stars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tell me, O thou <hi>Holieſt</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ones</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt, Favourite</hi> of the <hi>Angels,</hi> ſecret Friend of the <hi>Eternal, Envoy Extraordinary</hi> from the <hi>Omnipotent, Agent Incognito</hi> for the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Heaven!</hi> Tell me by what <hi>Chart</hi> I ſhall ſteer my Courſe through this <hi>Life,</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain as the Sea, and toſs'd with as many Tempeſts. I find in my ſelf, manifeſt Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to Vertue, and whatſoever is Good: Yet I ſtill miſtake the Methods of attaining my End. I wou'd fain be Perfectly Pious, Juſt and Wiſe, but know not how to compaſs my Deſign. One Event or other, ſtill fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates my Labour: Either a Friend or an Enemy, a Relation or a Stranger, Caſualties Without, or my Paſſions Within, ſtop me in the Beginning, or the Midſt of the Glorious Career, the Race which cannot be run with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noble Agonies.</p>
                  <p>Then I take Breath, and rowzing my ſelf with freſh Vigours, I cheerfully addreſs to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102963:20"/>the Combat, which crowns the <hi>Victor</hi> with <hi>Immortality.</hi> My Courage is Great, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution fix'd, at the Firſt ſetting out: I gain Ground on a Sudden, the <hi>Wheels</hi> of my <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> are for a Time like thoſe of the <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe Momentary Advances are not perceiv'd by <hi>Mortals.</hi> But before I get half way to the <hi>Meridian,</hi> ſome Unskillful <hi>Phaeton,</hi> an Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Thought or a Giddy Paſſion, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws me. Either Old Habits or New Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, hinder me from gaining the Prize, in the <hi>Olympicks</hi> of <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, often foil'd, I retire with Shame and Weakneſs: And finding no Redreſs within, I fly to thee, who art Created a <hi>Director</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twill be an Offence to make Repetitions, and ask thy Counſel again: I will henceforth endeavour to follow thy <hi>Example,</hi> which is certainly the moſt <hi>Correct Rule</hi> of a <hi>Religious Life.</hi> But then I cannot ſerve the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> in this <hi>Poſt.</hi> Reſolve my Doubts.

If I cannot arrive at the <hi>Perfection</hi> I aim at, I will at leaſt endeavour to be as <hi>Good</hi> as I can. There is a <hi>Religious</hi> Dexterity, by which a Man may in the Midſt of <hi>Worldly</hi> Buſineſs, make to himſelf <hi>Paths</hi> of <hi>Innocence,</hi> and walk free from the <hi>General Contagion</hi> of <hi>Mortals.</hi> If I cannot perform any <hi>Eminent Good,</hi> I will take Care to abſtain from <hi>Enormous Evils:</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:102963:21"/>Neither will I commit the <hi>Leaſt,</hi> without a <hi>Good Intention;</hi> which I am aſſured by the <hi>Mufti,</hi> ſometimes ſanctifies a <hi>Bad Action.</hi> If I <hi>lye</hi> or <hi>forſwear</hi> my ſelf, it ſhall be to ſerve my <hi>Great Maſter.</hi> If I diſſemble my <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and Counterfeit a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to my ſelf, the greater Advantage of the <hi>Muſſulman Faith.</hi> Thus, ſome Higher End, ſhall always direct my Intention and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances.</p>
                  <p>But if thou ſhalt tell me after all, That this is not the Way to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> I will forſake all Worldly Intereſt, wherein I find ſo many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements, and take up my Reſidence in ſome humble Cave, or Cleft of a Rock, or Hollow of a Tree, where I will ſpend the Reſt of my Days, in Contemplating the <hi>Firſt Eſſence,</hi> and all that flows from it. I will bid a Final Adieu to this <hi>Perfidious Age,</hi> to the <hi>Vain Generation</hi> of <hi>Mortals</hi> that live in it, to whoſe Converſe I ſhall have Reaſon to prefer that of the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> who are far more Innocent, and leſs debauch'd than <hi>Men.</hi> Even <hi>Lyons</hi> and <hi>Tygers</hi> in the Utmoſt Fury of their Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, abſtain from preying on thoſe of their Own <hi>Kind.

                  <p>I ſpeak not of the Ancient <hi>Scythians, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagetes</hi> or <hi>Tartars,</hi> nor of the more Modern <hi>Salvages</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> who ſtuff'd their greedy Paunches with Human Fleſh.

                  </p>
                  <p>Nor do I tax the more excuſable <hi>Epicuriſm</hi> of thoſe, who ranſack all the <hi>Elements</hi> for Dainties, whoſe Tables are loaded with the ſlaughter'd Carcaſſes of <hi>Birds, Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Fiſhes;</hi> their Houſes polluted with an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Profuſion of the <hi>Blood</hi> of thoſe <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> which the <hi>Eternal Mind</hi> Form'd to Live, and Enjoy the Fruits of the Earth, as well as our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>But I accuſe the Oppreſſors of Men, thoſe <hi>Cannibals</hi> in Diſguiſe, whoſe very <hi>Bread</hi> is mingled with the <hi>Marrow</hi> of the <hi>Poor;</hi> and their greater Delicacies are <hi>Ragoo's,</hi> compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans:</hi> Whilſt they ſtarve and ruine whole Families, to ſupport a Needleſs Grandeur, a Momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Pomp, which vaniſhes almoſt as ſoon as it appears.</p>

                  <p>THere are Two Actions, which take up all the Diſcourſe at Preſent. One is the Siege of <hi>Stenay,</hi> a Strong Town in <hi>Flanders,</hi> before which the <hi>French</hi> Army is newly laid down. The other, is the Inveſting of <hi>Arras</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis the Preſence of many Illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, that renders both theſe Sieges conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. In the <hi>French</hi> Camp are preſent, the <hi>King, Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> and all the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> of the <hi>Court.</hi> In the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> are <hi>Arch-Duke Leopold,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde, Francis Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with others of <hi>Prime Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are very Vigorous on both Sides, in preſſing and defending theſe Two Places; as if the <hi>Fate</hi> of both <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> were now at Stake. In my Opinion, <hi>France</hi> runs the Greateſt Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: For, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhou'd prove Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in what 'tis ſaid they have reſolv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, the Relief of <hi>Stenay;</hi> If they ſhould give Battle, and get the Victory, a Way would be open for them to penetrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bowels of <hi>France.</hi> And 'tis thought, many Towns in this <hi>Kingdom</hi> wou'd open their Gates to them, whilſt the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> is at the Head of their Army, who does all Things in the Name of the <hi>French</hi> King: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102963:23"/>his <hi>Rebellion</hi> it ſelf, is maſqu'd under the Specious Title, <hi>Of taking up Arms, to reſcue the Captive</hi> King <hi>from the Hands of</hi> Mazarini <hi>and his Adherents.</hi> A pretty Way of ſeducing the People from their Obedience. The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſians,</hi> and indeed all the <hi>French,</hi> are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Cabals and Parties; ſome eſpouſing the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Intereſt, whilſt others manifeſt an Incorruptible Loyalty to their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign.</hi> I approve the <hi>Morals</hi> of the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet privately rejoice at the <hi>Treaſons</hi> of the Former, wiſhing their <hi>Inteſtine</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels may continue till the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</hi>

From him I receive frequent Advice, of the moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Matters in that <hi>Theatre</hi> of <hi>War.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me, That the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi>'s Preſence in the Siege of <hi>Stenay,</hi> inſpires his Soldiers with more than Ordinary Vigor: And, That he ſhews daily Proofs of an extraordinary Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. He was one whole Night on Horſe-back, giving Orders and directing his <hi>Enginiers.</hi> Next Morning, he ſent a Summons to the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour:</hi> Who made a ſtout Reply, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to hold out to the laſt Extremity; and therefore ſally'd out of the Town with a Party of Reſolute Men, who kill'd near Four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the Beſiegers.</p>
                  <p>But alas, theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> are only ſtout, whilſt well fed: Not knowing what it is to endure the Rigours of Famine, and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102963:24"/>Hardſhips. In all the <hi>Weſtern Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,</hi> they cannot match the Bravery of a <hi>Garriſon</hi> in the Impregnable <hi>Fortreſs</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> Famous in our <hi>Annals</hi> for ſuſtaining a <hi>Seven Years</hi> Siege, when the Mighty <hi>Timurlen</hi> lay before it with his <hi>Invincible</hi> Army. That <hi>Scourge</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to terrify the Beſieged, and give 'em an Earneſt of his Reſolution, caus'd all the Old Trees round about this Place to be cut down, and Young ones to be planted in far greater Numbers: Declaring at the ſame Time, <hi>That he would not raiſe the Siege, till thoſe Trees ſhou'd be mature enough to bear Fruit.</hi> When that Time came, he ſent a <hi>Preſent</hi> of the <hi>Fruits</hi> to the <hi>Governor</hi> of the <hi>Garriſon,</hi> as likewiſe of <hi>Mutton,</hi> with this Meſſage, <hi>That he took pity on ſo brave a Man, fearing leſt he would ſtarve for want of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Governor</hi> had receiv'd theſe <hi>Preſents,</hi> turning to the Meſſenger he ſaid, <hi>Go tell thy Maſter, I thank him for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Fruits: But, for the Fleſh, we ſhall have no Occaſion, ſo long as our Ewes afford us Milk enough to ſuſtain the Whole Garriſon. And that thy Maſter may be aſſur'd we are not in Want of that, I will ſend him a Preſent of Cheeſes made of the ſame.</hi> Accordingly, he commanded Four <hi>Cheeſes</hi> to be deliver'd to the Meſſenger. Which when <hi>Timurlen</hi> ſaw, and had heard the Words of the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> he deſpair'd of reducing that Place, tho' he had lain before it <hi>Seven Years,</hi> wanting only <hi>Two Moons.</hi> But, had he underſtood
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102963:24"/>what ſort of <hi>Cheeſes</hi> theſe were, he wou'd no doubt have chang'd his Reſolution. For, it ſeems, they were made of the <hi>Milk</hi> of <hi>Bitches,</hi> and were the very laſt Suſtenance the <hi>Garriſon</hi> had, except the <hi>Fleſh</hi> it ſelf of thoſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Animals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Believe me, Sage <hi>Miniſter,</hi> ſuch Examples of Patience and Fortitude, are very Rare. And this was the more Remarkable, in that it was the Firſt Place, where that Invincible <hi>General</hi> had met with a Repulſe.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102963:25"/>Reaſon to be Merry in this <hi>Life,</hi> than the Thoughtful and Penſive <hi>Mahmut</hi> can find out.</p>
                  <p>On the other Side, I ſpend not this Day in Extreme and Fruitleſs <hi>Mourning:</hi> But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an Indifference of Mind, I Conſecrate it to the <hi>Service</hi> of my <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation:</hi> Which are the onely Things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in Mortal Man.</p>
                  <p>From the Minute that I firſt awak'd this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I have been pondering on <hi>my ſelf,</hi> and <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> I ſuffer'd my Anxious Thoughts to ſtart back beyond the <hi>Hour</hi> of my <hi>Birth,</hi> reflecting on the <hi>Impriſonment</hi> I ſuffer'd in my <hi>Mother</hi>'s <hi>Womb:</hi> Which yet I cannot in the leaſt remember. And this is the Caſe of all Men. We know not how we came into this Open <hi>World</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> from that <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> nor that ever we were ſo ſhut up, but as we are told by our <hi>Parents;</hi> and Common Experience confirms us, that this is the <hi>Lot</hi> of all <hi>Mortals.</hi> How then ſhall we be able to diſcover, what <hi>State</hi> we were in before our <hi>Conception?</hi> Whether we were in the Rank of <hi>Things</hi> which have <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,</hi> or whether we were not hid in the <hi>Womb</hi> of <hi>Nothing?</hi> I tell thee, this Thought has fill'd me with great Inquietudes. I am reſtleſs to know my own <hi>Original.</hi> I wou'd fain be inform'd, if that which they call the <hi>Soul,</hi> be a <hi>Subſtance</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>Body,</hi> or onely the <hi>Finer Part</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> a <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence</hi> of the <hi>Elements.</hi> If it be <hi>diſtinct,</hi> as I have Reaſon to believe, 'twou'd be a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102963:25"/>Happineſs, to be ſatisfied where it was, before united to this <hi>Machine</hi> of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Bones:</hi> And whether that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> be <hi>Voluntary</hi> or <hi>Forc'd.</hi> For, I muſt profeſs my ſelf to be altogether in the Dark as to theſe Scrutinies. Sometimes I join with the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and conclude, all <hi>Humane Souls</hi> to be <hi>Particles</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature, Beams</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Sun:</hi> And that though our <hi>Light</hi> be now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcur'd and veil'd under this Cloud of <hi>Earthly Matter,</hi> yet we have formerly ſhin'd with an undiminiſh'd Splendor, when only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body'd in the Clearer Air, or more Refined Subſtance of the Sky. Perhaps, think I, for ſome Errors committed in that <hi>Superiour State,</hi> we are ſent down into theſe <hi>Bodies</hi> as into <hi>Priſons</hi> for our <hi>Puniſhment.</hi> Then I am vex'd at the <hi>Fatal Dullneſs</hi> of my <hi>Memory,</hi> that retains no <hi>Idea</hi> of my <hi>paſt Condition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At other Times (for like all <hi>Mortals</hi> I am ſubject to Change) I embrace the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> which thou knoweſt are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally entertain'd all o'er the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the <hi>Tranſmigration</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> from one Living Creature to another, I cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but that I have been an <hi>Elephant,</hi> a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,</hi> or a <hi>Horſe,</hi> or perhaps ſome more <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Animal;</hi> and for ought I know, I have undergone all the Various Kinds of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis</hi> that ever <hi>Ovid</hi> mention<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d.</p>
                  <p>However, be it how it will, I ſee no Grounds to make any Extravagant Solemnity on the account of my being born to what I am now, that is, a <hi>Man.</hi> For, I think we

                  <p>We boaſt of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences;</hi> yet the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of Mortals are always moſt ſenſible, <hi>That they know Nothing.</hi> One Man builds a State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Houſe, a Place of Repoſe and Refuge for himſelf and his <hi>Family:</hi> Another comes and pulls it down, demoliſhing the only ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Monument</hi> of his Brother's <hi>Prudence,</hi> or rather of his <hi>Folly,</hi> who perhaps conſum'd the greateſt Part of his <hi>Eſtate</hi> in that Coſtly <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick;</hi> Whereas, among all his <hi>Sciences,</hi> had he but learn'd to <hi>KNOW HIMSELF;</hi> an humble convenient <hi>Cottage</hi> wou'd have ſerv'd his <hi>Neceſſities</hi> during this <hi>Short Life,</hi> and ſo he might have avoided the <hi>Stroke</hi> of <hi>Envy.</hi>

                  <p>SOmetimes we ſeem to be aſleep here in this City, for Want of News. But of late, we have been rowz'd by Poſt upon Poſt: Some bringing Intelligence of the Surrender of <hi>Stenay</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King, others of the Revolt of <hi>Barcelona</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But that which is of freſheſt Date, and for which all the Streets of <hi>Paris</hi> are this Night Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Bonefires, is the Relief of <hi>Arras;</hi> Where the <hi>French</hi> have obtained a Glorious Victory. The Number of the Dead is not yet known, but ſaid to be very great. And 'tis certain the Victors have taken above Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Thouſand Priſoners, Sixty Cannon, Five Thouſand Waggons, an Equal Number of Horſes, with all the Plate and Rich Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde, Arch-Duke Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold, Francis</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the other <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army. In Fine, the <hi>French</hi> are Maſters of the Town, and of the Field, and all <hi>Flanders</hi> appears now too little to hold 'em.</p>
                  <p>Theſe continual Succeſſes redound much to the Eſtabliſhment of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> who now ſeems above the Stroke of Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or Malice. Yet no Man can call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102963:27"/>Happy till the Hour of his Death, which alone releaſes us from all Human Miſeries.</p>
                  <p>Some Days ago I receiv'd a Letter from <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi,</hi> which informs me of the Death of the <hi>Roman</hi> King, and of ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies which were ſeen before, and about the Time of his Departure.</p>
                  <p>When he was firſt taken Sick, there aroſe a Violent Tempeſt of Wind, which blew down the <hi>Croſs</hi> from one of their <hi>Churches.</hi> After this, follow'd a terrible Earthquake, that ſhook the whole City, threatning to remove its Foundations. Moreover, an Old <hi>Eagle,</hi> a Domeſtick of the <hi>Imperial Palace,</hi> and that had liv'd there many Years, took Wing the Day before the <hi>King</hi>'s Sickneſs, and flew quite away. Then the Bells of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel rung Thrice of their own Accord in the Space of Twelve Hours. Thus far the <hi>Jew</hi> aſſures me is true. There are Additional Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, of ſtrange Apparitions that were ſeen about <hi>Vienna</hi> during the Sickneſs of this <hi>Prince,</hi> as of a <hi>Funeral Proceſſion</hi> after Midnight, through the Courts of the <hi>Palace;</hi> and of a Show'r of Warm Blood that fell at Noon Day in the Streets of that City. But theſe I have only from the Mouth of Common Fame, which, thou knoweſt, does not always ſpeak Truth.</p>
                  <p>I deſire thee and all the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to make a Diſtinction between thoſe Paſſages which I aſcertain, and the Doubtful Relations of the Multitude. In theſe Caſes, Men are prone to <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and love to be the Authors of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102963:27"/>Portentous News. But thou may'ſt believe what the <hi>Jew</hi> relates; for he never affects to be Fabulous.</p>
                  <p>'Twould tempt one to ask, What ſtrange hidden <hi>Power</hi> produces theſe Unuſual Signs? Whether we Mortals are under the Cuſtody of <hi>Inviſible Beings,</hi> who teach the <hi>Elements</hi> and other <hi>Creatures</hi> to utter the <hi>Future Events</hi> of <hi>Fate?</hi> Or, Whether all theſe Things which appear ſo ſtrange and ſurprizing, be not mere Caſualties; Accidents of <hi>Nature</hi> happening of Courſe, and only made Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by their Timing? Who knows, but that the Voluntary Ringing of the Bells, might proceed from the Motion of the Tower where they hung, during the Earthquake? Or, Why, need we wonder, that a <hi>Croſs</hi> or a <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent</hi> ſhou'd be blown down from the Top of a high <hi>Minaret,</hi> by a Violent Tempeſt of Wind?</p>
                  <p>Theſe Things appear to me as Natural, as for the Rain to lodge all the Corn in the Fields, or for a Storm to tear up Trees by the Roots, overturn Houſes, and commit a Thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Violences. Neither do I perceive any Thing worth Admiration in the Flight of the <hi>Eagle.</hi> Perhaps, ſome <hi>Royal</hi> Caprice ſprung in the Head of that <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Birds,</hi> which he ne'er felt before. There's Nothing of Prodigy in all this, but only becauſe it happen'd at ſuch a Critical Juncture. Had it been at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time, no body perhaps wou'd have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Notice of it, any more than they do of Earth quakes at <hi>Naples,</hi> which are Common
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102963:28"/>in that Country, where the Earth is very Hollow, being made ſo by Veins of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally burning <hi>Sulphur.</hi> They have felt ſeveral in that <hi>Kingdom</hi> within theſe Two <hi>Moons,</hi> as alſo at <hi>Rome.</hi> But no great Hurt has been done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nathan</hi> informs me alſo, That the <hi>Venetian Embaſſador</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> has diſtributed great Sums of Money, in Token of his Joy, for the late Victory that <hi>Republick</hi> obtained againſt the <hi>Moſelmans.</hi> This appears to me a Real Prodigy, That the <hi>Ottomans</hi> who are Invincible by Land, yet ſtill come off with Loſs at Sea.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> of <hi>Sueden,</hi> is expected here e'er long. She came to <hi>Antwerp</hi> in the Habit of a Man, which occaſions Variety of Cenſures. The <hi>French</hi> call her, The Learned <hi>Amazon,</hi> She being well vers'd in many <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi> and <hi>Sciences:</hi> They extol her Virtues and Perfections, ſtyling her, The <hi>Phoenix</hi> of this Age. All the Weſtern <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> are devout Admirers of Women. And one of their Famous <hi>Sages,</hi> whom they call <hi>Henry Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> wrote a ſelect <hi>Treatiſe</hi> in Praiſe of that Sex, wherein he endeavours to prove, That they are more Excellent and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures than Men. But he wou'd find few Proſelytes in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, there have been very Famous Women in all Ages, and it wou'd be Envy in Men to deny them their due Praiſe. Such was <hi>Dido</hi> Queen of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the <hi>Roman Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia,</hi> the <hi>Sybills, Theana Pythagoras</hi>'s Wife, with his Daughter <hi>Dama; Sappho</hi> the <hi>Poeteſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:102963:28"/>with Innumerable others both of <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> Renowned for their Virtue, Learning, or Valour in the Wars. But it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they therefore ſurpaſs Men.</p>
                  <p>Let us keep the Rank, in which <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> have plac'd us, without being Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh or Effeminate. And this is the beſt Way to get and retain the Eſteem of that Nice Sex, who hate a Clown, and deſpiſe a Dotard.</p>

                  <p>THou art he, to whom I can unmask. With others I converſe (like our Women in <hi>Turky</hi>) under a Veil. When I write to the <hi>Grandees</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> 'tis neceſſary for me to diſſemble many Things; and, to feign ſome, that I may be credited in Others, and not be ſuſpected in all. But with thee, I uſe no Artifice or Diſguiſe: Thou haſt a Kind of natural Right to my ſecret Thoughts, beyond the Claim of a Brother. I owe thee an Entire Confidence, on the Score of Friendſhip; and I ſeem to wrong my ſelf, when I conceal my Sentiments from thee. For, beſides the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102963:29"/>Tye of <hi>Blood,</hi> we were Partners together in the Adventures of Youth; and the mutual good Offices that paſs'd between us, faſten'd our Affections with Stronger Bands, than thoſe of our Birth. Nor were we ſo unhappy, as to ſuffer the little Youthful Emulations which are common between Sons of the ſame Mother, to ſtifle the more ſolid and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Efforts of real Love. Our Friendſhip grew up with our Years, cemented by Intereſt as well as Affection; and I eſteem <hi>Peſteli,</hi> but my ſelf in another Figure. If thou haſt the ſame Regard to me, I am happy. Let us continue to cheriſh this noble. Paſſion: The leaſt Coldneſs or Reſerve now, wou'd appear to me more hateful than a Divorce, more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible than Death.</p>
                  <p>'Tis but Reaſonable, That among the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Services our <hi>Great Maſter</hi> claims at our Hands, we ſhould employ ſome of our Time and Care on our Selves. We owe the <hi>Sultan</hi> much; but both He and We owe <hi>Nature</hi> more, without whoſe Bounty and Providence, We had never had the Honour, nor He the Profit of our being in his Debt. He is more deeply engaged in <hi>Fortune</hi>'s Tally than We; but in the Accompts of <hi>Nature,</hi> We are all Equal. She is the Univerſal Creditor of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. We are indebted to Her, for all we have; yet methinks, Nothing ſo much enhances our Score, as the ill Menage of Time. In that we ſtill run in Arrears, whilſt the haſty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes poſt forward, never to be revok'd; and yet, we neither lay hold on 'em in their Flight,

But, the Latter have a far worſe Influence on our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by exciting us to immoderate Deſire, Hope, Joy, and Grief for mere Trifles, the uncertain Products of <hi>Chance.</hi> Therefore

                  </p>
                  <p>When thou art diſpos'd to unbend thy Mind, I wou'd rather counſel thee, to uſe ſome healthful Exerciſe, ſuch as may ventilate thy melancholy Blood. Our Fathers were wont at ſuch Times <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  <p>What! tho' <hi>Claudius Caeſar</hi> devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Gaming with <hi>Dice,</hi> and wrote a <hi>Book</hi> in Praiſe of his Folly; What! tho' <hi>Domitian</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and <hi>Theodorick, King</hi> of the <hi>Goths,</hi> ſpent whole Nights and Days in this Unprofitable Play? Thou haſt not read or heard of ſuch Examples, among the Renowned Sons of <hi>Ottoman.</hi> Our Glorious <hi>Sultans,</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Vacant to theſe Fooleries. And if they had, their Practice cannot juſtify a <hi>Subject</hi>'s Imitation. Neither wouldſt thou be ſo in Love with Gaming, didſt thou conſider what unhappy Deſtinies have commonly attended the Votaries of <hi>Fortune.</hi> Whole Eſtates have been ſquander'd away at <hi>Dice</hi> in a Night, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies ruin'd, and the Gameſter himſelf Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd in the Morning. He that Yeſterday was Maſter of great Poſſeſſions, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102963:30"/>for <hi>Princes;</hi> by the Effects of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Vanity, has bereav'd himſelf of All, and is to Day become the Scorn of Beggars.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chineſes</hi> are ſo bewitch'd with Love of Gaming, That when they have loſt all their Stakes, they'll pawn themſelves, their Wives and Children; which if the Fortune of the <hi>Dice</hi> run againſt them, become all bond-Slaves to the Winner. Here is a <hi>Derviſe</hi> in this City, of the <hi>Order</hi> of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who lately came from <hi>China.</hi> Among other Learned Men, I ſometimes converſe with Him. He relates many pretty Paſſages of that People, but one is Tragical, whereof he himſelf was an Eye-Witneſs.</p>
                  <p>He ſays, That in the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Queintong,</hi> a certain <hi>Nobleman</hi> who had ſerv'd in the Wars, and acquir'd great Fame and Honour, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied by one of his Neighbours, who likewiſe had been a Captain and much in Favour at the <hi>Court.</hi> Their Emulations carried 'em to many Ill Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and at laſt to open Defiance. The <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> being made ſenſible of the Hatred that was between theſe Two Officers, and being unwilling their Fury ſhould precipitate them to the Ruine of each other, became himſelf an <hi>Arbitrator</hi> of their <hi>Quarrel;</hi> laying his Commands on 'em, to embrace and eat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is an aſſured Token of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Friendſhip in that Country. They obey'd the Will of their <hi>Sovereign.</hi> But ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up late one Night at <hi>Dice,</hi> it was the <hi>Captain</hi>'s ill Fortune, to loſe all he had to the <hi>Nobleman.</hi> Mad at his unluckly Chance, and in Hopes to retrieve his Loſs, he ſends for his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102963:31"/>Wife and Three Young Sons, whom with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he pawn'd to the <hi>Nobleman</hi> for a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sum of Money, and falls afreſh to play: But Fate was his Enemy; he loſt All. Whereupon in Deſpair, he ſtabs his Wife and Three Children, and laſtly falls on his own Sword; glorying, that he and his Family, ſhould thus eſcape a hated Captivity, to his Old Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, Dear <hi>Peſteli,</hi> had'ſt thou ſeen this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> wou'd it not have made thee reſolve againſt Gaming during thy Life? Aſſuredly, our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> frowns from his <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> on thoſe who violate his <hi>Laws.</hi> He knew our Paſſions, and which were the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; therefore he prohibited ſuch Things, as are moſt likely to betray us to Violence, and an Incurable Diſorder. If thou wilt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit thy ſelf a good <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> thou muſt not leap over theſe Prohibitions, accounting them ſmall and indifferent Trifles. Remember the Saying of the <hi>holy Doctor,</hi> and <hi>Leader</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Armies, the Chaſt <hi>Oſman, A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Spark will ſet a whole City on Fire.</hi> And the <hi>Roman Satyriſt</hi> has obſerv'd, <hi>That no Man becomes Wicked all at once.</hi> Think then with thy ſelf, 'tis for this Reaſon the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God</hi> has forbid Gaming to the <hi>True Faithful;</hi> not as a Thing in it ſelf Naturally Evil, but onely Morally, ſo as it is a Step to the greateſt Vices. For whilſt we captivate our ſelves to Chance, we loſe our Authority over our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. We ſtand or fall at the Uncertain Caſt of the <hi>Dice.</hi> We are Slaves to the feebleſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102963:31"/>Wiſhes; which if they ſucceed not, we grow Furious, Profligate and Impious. Baniſhing all Prudence, Temperance and Juſtice, we become Impudent, and fit for the blackeſt Crimes.</p>
                  <p>Take not in Ill Part the wholeſome Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of a Brother, who manifeſts his Love, in thus reproving thee without Flattery. Uſe the ſame Freedom, when thou heareſt I am guilty of any <hi>

                  <p>I Believe, thou haſt a Mind to try my Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; to make an Experiment upon me, and ſee, Whether I'm Proof againſt thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: Elſe, why ſhould <hi>Kenan Baſſa</hi>'s Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be reviv'd again, after it had been bury'd above theſe Four Years? I examine not, what mighty Intereſt thou haſt in that <hi>Officer,</hi> that thou afreſh eſpouſeſt his Old Quarrel, as if 'twere thy own. Thy Affairs are beſt known to thy ſelf. But let me tell thee, 'twill not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102963:32"/>redound much to thy Credit, to be found Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. I honour thee with all the Devoir that is due to a <hi>Miniſter</hi> in thy <hi>Station,</hi> and with ſomething more: For, the Eſteem a Man has for his Friend, is Singular and beyond Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. But ſtill he owes ſome Regard to himſelf. Self-Preſervation, is Rooted in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Nature; and few will be Knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Complaiſant to their Ruine. I am puzzl'd what to think, or how to write, thy laſt Letter has put my Mind into ſuch a Hurly-Burly. A Thouſand Imaginations like Whirl-winds, tear up my moſt ſolid Thoughts by the Roots. I'm in as Wild a Condition as a Man in an Earthquake, leaping this Way and that Way, yet knows not where to fix his Foot in Safety.</p>
                  <p>If I perſevere in calling thee Friend, perhaps thou wilt accuſe me of Preſumption. If I change my Style, and ſuppoſe thee under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Character, Ingratitude will be laid to my Charge. To vindicate my Actions, will be Interpreted Obſtinacy; and to own my ſelf in the Fault, will be counted Weakneſs. Nay, all the World will call me Fool, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning my ſelf for Things whereof I never was Guilty. What ſhall I do in this Caſe? I am Naturally Thoughtful and Melancholy. The Words that ſpring from Reſentment, cleave faſt to my Mind, and breed a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Inferences. My buſie Apprehenſion, extracts Menaces out of the moſt Artificial Expreſſions. I look on my ſelf, as mark'd out for a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> one Time or other. The

                     <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny</hi> be done, Early or Late. I will not go out of my Road to avoid it; Since it is but an Ill Husbandry of Time, to borrow it from the Ineffable Joys of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> to multiply a few Days or Years, of a Miſerable Life on <hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> and the Reſt of my Accuſers, let them know, that I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in doing my Duty to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> without warping to the Right Hand or to the Left, for Fear or Favour.</p>
                  <p>But if my <hi>Private</hi> Agency in theſe <hi>Parts</hi> meet with Rubs and Checks for Want of Money, let the Blame reſt on thoſe whoſe <hi>Charge</hi> it is, to ſupply me with what is Neceſſary for a Man in my <hi>Station:</hi> For, henceforward, <hi>Mahmut</hi> will be reproach'd no more for demanding his <hi>Penſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Think not, 'tis an eaſy Thing for a Man to be always a Counterfeit, and never to have his Mind unbent; to act Two contrary Parts at the ſame Time; to be true and falſe; a <hi>Muſſulman</hi> and Servant of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in Reality, a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in Appearance.

                  <p>THE <hi>Pope</hi> has been ſick for a conſiderable Time, and 'tis now ſtrongly reported, He is dead. They talk of an <hi>Expreſs</hi> that is come to the <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> to certifie him of it, and to conſult about the Next <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> But this is not credited here; being onely look'd upon as a <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Artifice, to ſound the Inclinations of this <hi>Court</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that ſo they may be able to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, when the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall really die. And 'tis not expected he ſhould live long, being of a great Age, and worn out with Cares and Sickneſs.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain he has made his <hi>Will,</hi> wherein Two Millions of Gold are given to the <hi>Treaſury</hi> founded by his <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> to ſerve the <hi>Church</hi> in its extreme Neceſſities. But 'tis a Thouſand
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102963:33"/>to one, if ſome future <hi>Pontiff</hi> ſucceeding in that <hi>Chair,</hi> do not in his Unnerring Judgment, interpret his own Perſonal Occaſions, or thoſe of his Nephews, to be the Extreme Neceſſities of the <hi>Church;</hi> and then, all this huge Maſs of Wealth, is Infallibly gone.</p>
                  <p>He has likewiſe bequeath'd large Legacies to his <hi>Siſter-in-Law,</hi> whom they call <hi>Donna Olympia;</hi> and to others of his Relations and Creatures. And 'tis thought, this <hi>Lady</hi> will more than doubly pay her ſelf, having the Management of all his Affairs. Indeed, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his <hi>Reign,</hi> it may be ſaid, the whole <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church</hi> was govern'd by a Woman. For this <hi>Prelate,</hi> wou'd never do any Thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her Advice.</p>
                  <p>She was born of an Obſcure <hi>Family,</hi> but is of a high Spirit, Ambitious of <hi>Rule,</hi> and a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Abilities: Extremely Covetous and Subtle; turning and winding all Events to her own Proſit. All <hi>Preferments</hi> were at her Diſpoſal: She ſold <hi>Biſhopricks, Abbeys</hi> and other <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Dignities</hi> at her own Rates, and to whom ſhe pleas'd: In fine, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had any Buſineſs with the <hi>Pope,</hi> made their Addreſſes to her. By which means, ſhe has heap'd together a Prodigious Treaſure, and is eſteem'd the Richeſt <hi>Lady</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> 'Tis thought, ſhe wou'd have ſold even the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, the <hi>Capital</hi> Seat of the <hi>Chriſtian Empire,</hi> rather than refus'd a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate Offer of Gold, cou'd ſhe have met with a Chapman to her Mind.

                  <p>In the mean while, I am extremely affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to hear of our continual Loſſes by Sea.

Yet <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaein</hi> the <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> and <hi>General</hi> in <hi>Candia,</hi> has perform'd very Heroick Things.

Neither Age nor Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, with all the other Infirmities and Croſſes of Human Life, had ſo alter'd her Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that I eaſily diſcern'd the manifeſt Features, Lineaments and Air of my Mother. I concluded therefore, it muſt be <hi>She,</hi> or her <hi>Apparition,</hi> if there be any ſuch Things.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were my Firſt Thoughts, in that Waking Trance: But her Voice and Addreſs, ſoon put me out of Doubt, when impatient to ſee me ſtand like one Thunder-ſtruck, ſhe ran to me with open Arms and Tears of Joy in her Eyes; crying out with a Tone and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection peculiar to Women. <hi>Art thou alive, my Son</hi> Mahmut? <hi>Do theſe Eyes ſee thee, or am I in a Dream?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my Part, I was as much upon the Rapture as ſhe, and hardly knew how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my ſelf, or what to ſay or do. Yet the Fear I was in leſt ſomebody in the Houſe ſhou'd over-hear us, and make ill Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Paſſionate Interview, taught me a Leſſon of Moderation and Prudence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beckon'd to her, to ſuppreſs her Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and converſe by <hi>Signs,</hi> as the Cuſtom is at the <hi>Myſterious Port.</hi> Thoſe Silent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of our mutual Love, Joy and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, were not leſs ſignificant, becauſe not cloath'd in Words. Thou know'ſt, there's Eloquence enough in this Mute Language.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102963:36"/>And I was Jealous of Words, leſt ſome Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Soul might underſtand us, tho' we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd in <hi>Arabick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After our firſt Endearments and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were over, in which my Couſin <hi>Iſouf</hi> alſo had his Share (for we were all recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally overjoy'd to ſee one another, in this Neſt of <hi>Infidels</hi>) I began to conſult the Safety of us all Three, in providing convenient Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for my Mother and Kinſman. In Order to this, we made a Viſit to <hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> who entertained us at a Banquet, after the Faſhion of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> We advis'd with that honeſt <hi>Hebrew</hi> about our Affairs; I having made frequent and ſufficient Proof of his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Friendſhip. In fine, he took them both into his own Houſe, under the Notion of <hi>Greeks,</hi> his Acquaintance; judging this the ſecureſt Way to prevent any Diſcovery, or even the leaſt Suſpicion of our Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They have continu'd there theſe Five Days, and their Character has not been que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd by any. I viſit 'em daily, and we paſs away many Hours in recounting the different Adventures of our Lives, in diſcourſing of our Friends in <hi>Arabia, Greece</hi> and other <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and in concerting the beſt Methods to ſerve one, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Well, but all this while I believe thou art Impatient to know what Motive of their own, or Turn of Fortune, drove them into
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102963:36"/>ſo remote a <hi>Region</hi> as <hi>France,</hi> a <hi>Country</hi> Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by none but <hi>Infidels?</hi> Shall I tell thee in a Word? 'Twas Love, on her Part; and the Deſire of Novelty, on his.</p>
                  <p>Our Kinſman <hi>Iſouf,</hi> from his Childhood felt powerful Inclinations to travel: Which encreas'd with his Years, and were much heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd by his Converſe with <hi>Greeks, Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Franks,</hi> and ſome <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> who had ſeen many Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, both in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Relations they made of the Curioſities they had ſeen, and of their own Adventures, fir'd his Youthful Blood, and he form'd a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to depart, with the Firſt Convenience, from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and viſit all the <hi>Regions</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> if his Life and Health wou'd hold out. I formerly acquainted thee, that he had ſurvey'd the Greateſt Part of <hi>Aſia:</hi> Since which he ſet forth again, and having finiſh'd his Travels in that <hi>Quarter</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> he bent his Courſe for <hi>Africk;</hi> where he viſited <hi>Egypt, Barbary,</hi> the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez,</hi> with that of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> and many other <hi>Regions</hi> under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> too tedious for me at this Time to mention particularly, becauſe I write in Haſte. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I ſhall give thee a more ample Account of his Obſervations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherein thou wilt find, that <hi>Iſouf</hi> has not altogether loſt his Time.</p>
                  <p>At length, having ſatisfi'd himſelf with whatſoever he thought worthy to be ſeen and known in that <hi>Southern Tract,</hi> he parted from <hi>Fez</hi> with a Deſign to ſee <hi>Europe.</hi> Some <hi>Bills</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:102963:37"/>of <hi>Exchange,</hi> caus'd him to take <hi>Grand Caire</hi> in his Way, where he encounter'd my Mother. She perceiving, that he wou'd take Shipping directly for <hi>France,</hi> reſolv'd to lay hold on ſo favourable an Opportunity, of ſeeing me once more before ſhe dy'd. Wherefore, imparting her Deſign to him, <hi>Iſouf</hi> offer'd her his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Service. And having ſettl'd her Affairs at <hi>Caire,</hi> and pack'd up her Money, Jewels and other Neceſſaries, they took the Road of <hi>Scanderoon,</hi> where they ſoon arriv'd; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into the Habit of <hi>Greeks, Iſouf</hi> alſo ſpeaking pretty well that <hi>Language</hi> and the <hi>Lingua Franca,</hi> they bargain'd with the Maſter of a Veſſel then lying in the Harbour, and bound for <hi>Marſeilles:</hi> He took them on Board, and under the Protection and Favour of <hi>Heaven,</hi> they arriv'd ſafe at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and are now in this City.</p>
                  <p>Yet amidſt all the Pleaſure I conceive in the Preſence of ſo near a Relation as a Mother, I am not without ſome Qualms of Fear, leſt ſome Unfortunate Occurrence ſhou'd diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her to be no <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> For then, the Iſſue might prove dangerous both to her and me.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Iſouf,</hi> he deſigns to tarry no longer in <hi>Paris,</hi> than to inform himſelf of what is moſt Remarkable in this City, and to ſatisfie the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ends of a Traveller. From hence, after he has viſited the Chiefeſt Cities in <hi>France,</hi> he talks of travelling into <hi>Flanders, Holland, Germany, Suedeland,</hi> and the other <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> But for <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal,</hi> he has
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102963:37"/>no Thoughts; either out of Fear of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi> which is very ſevere in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, or out of an Averſion for the People who expell'd the <hi>Moors,</hi> of which he relates very Tragical Stories, which they told him during his Reſidence at <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez.</hi> In a Word, he gives this Character of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> That he is a <hi>Mungrel,</hi> between a <hi>Man</hi> and a <hi>Devil.</hi> He likes the Company of the <hi>French,</hi> in Regard they converſe with a Natural and Unreſerv'd Freedom, which becomes them very well. But he has ſpoke with none but Travellers yet, who have been otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, than in ſtudying the Artificial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes of <hi>Courtiers.</hi> If he ſojourns the Space of Three <hi>Moons</hi> in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> he will find ſome of the <hi>French</hi> as Affected in their Way, as other People: He will encounter with a New Sort of <hi>Frenchmen</hi> in every <hi>Province.</hi> For <hi>France</hi> is a mere <hi>Gallimaufry,</hi> made up of the Fragments and Remnants of other <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> They differ alſo in their <hi>Language,</hi> as well as in their <hi>Manners,</hi> one from another. So that the Inhabitants of <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> and <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne,</hi> can hardly be underſtood by thoſe of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Blois,</hi> with the Adjacent <hi>Parts.</hi> Theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> People, are not Curious in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the <hi>Dialect</hi> of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Age,</hi> introduces a Change in their <hi>Speech.</hi> Neither are they diligent in retaining their <hi>Genealogies.</hi> Whereas in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> thou know'ſt, the <hi>Languages</hi> remain uncorrupted, the ſame now as they were Two Thouſand Years agoe, or from the <hi>Confuſion</hi> of <hi>Babel.</hi>

                  <p>THIS comes to thee by the Hand of a truſty Friend: Give entire Credence to his Inſtructions. To ſay I'm ſorry to hear of thy Misfortune, wou'd but faintly expreſs my Paſſion: 'Tis not eaſily deſcrib'd in Words. I am as Melancholy as an <hi>Antelope,</hi> when the <hi>Sun</hi>'s in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with <hi>Saturn.</hi> This is a ſad ſort of a Beaſt, that will neither Eat, Drink nor Sleep, during that Dull Aſpect.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Gods</hi> Name, how cam'ſt thou to be ſo free with thy Tongue among the <hi>Romans?</hi> Or, what tempted thee to meddle with their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws?</hi> Was it not enough, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102963:38"/>thou and all the <hi>Jews</hi> in that City, had Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to frequent your <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and there curſe the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in Antiquated <hi>Hebrew;</hi> muſt you needs Rail at 'em in plain <hi>Italian</hi> too? And that, over your Cups, when Men ought to be good-Natur'd to all the World? Of what import is it to you, whether they be <hi>Idolaters</hi> or no, ſo long as they give you Leave to Adore <hi>One God, Creator</hi> of the <hi>Worlds?</hi> Or, what ſignifies it, if they are Guilty of Ten Thouſand Injuſtices and Follies among themſelves, whilſt you live quietly under their Protection and Government? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donai,</hi> I'm aſham'd of the Immorality of thoſe of thy <hi>Nation.</hi> I bluſh for your Ingratitude, Pride and Malice. Surely, if the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> did really believe what they profeſs, they wou'd Sacrifice you all to the <hi>Ghoſt</hi> of their <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom they ſay, you <hi>Crucify'd.</hi> They wou'd not leave a <hi>Jew</hi> living in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but do their utmoſt to exterminate you from the Earth. I ſpeak not this as my Wiſh; but only to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid your Impertinence and Vanity, in thus fooliſhly provoking thoſe, with whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion it is, that you live and enjoy the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prophet Moſes,</hi> your <hi>Law-Giver,</hi> left you another Rule, a Leſſon of Civility, when he ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not blaſpheme the Gods of the People.</hi> Had thou and thy Companions o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd this <hi>Precept,</hi> ye might have been at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: But 'tis bad falling into the Hands of the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> However, I am glad to hear, that you are not tranſported to the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102963:39"/>St. <hi>Angelo.</hi> That would have been a Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Remove, at this Juncture. But now, as I'm inform'd, not one of you is in Danger: For, they ſay, that all the Priſoners in <hi>Rome,</hi> are by Cuſtom releas'd upon the Death of the <hi>Pope,</hi> except thoſe who are in that Fatal <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs.</hi> And 'tis Generally ſuppos'd, the good Old <hi>Caliph</hi> is no long-liv'd Man. For, they never uſe to remove the Priſoners deſign'd for Death; till the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> are paſt all Hopes of the <hi>Holy Father</hi>'s Life.</p>
                  <p>However, in Regard there is no Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in Human Affairs, but a perpetual Change and Circulation of Events; leſt ſome Unhappy Turn of Fortune ſhou'd either now continue thy Reſtraint, or hereafter bereave thee of thy Liberty, I ſend thee here enclos'd, a <hi>Receipt</hi> of a <hi>Chymical</hi> Liquor, which may be of ſome Service to thee, in the ſtrongeſt Priſon on Earth. 'Twas reveal'd to me by my Mother, who learn'd it of an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Artiſt at <hi>Caire.</hi> Deſpiſe it not, becauſe it comes from a Woman's Hand: For I have made an Experiment of it, and find it effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. 'Twill render Iron as brittle as Glaſs. 'Tis more powerful than the Water of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Styx,</hi> which no Veſſel cou'd hold, but the Hoof of a <hi>Mule.</hi> After an Hours Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thou may'ſt make the thickeſt Barrs, Chains and Bolts, flie in a Thouſand Pieces, as if they were made of <hi>Porcelain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not wonder at this, when thou conſider'ſt the Innumerable ſtrange <hi>Inventions</hi> of Men prying into the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:102963:39"/>and Fortunate in their Searches. Above all, <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> has brought to Light the greateſt Prodigies of <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge.</hi> This My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious <hi>Science,</hi> was the peculiar Boaſt of the Primitive <hi>Egyptians,</hi> from whom all other <hi>Nations</hi> learn'd it. And had not <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf been inſtructed from his Youth in all the <hi>Learning</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> perhaps he would have been at a Loſs, when he Calcin'd the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> and gave the Duſt to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to be mix'd in their Drink, as the only Expiation of their <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Doubtleſs, this <hi>Secret,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, was tranſmitted down to thoſe Times from <hi>Philemon,</hi> the good <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who was in the Number of them who eſcap'd the <hi>Flood</hi> in <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Ark,</hi> and whoſe Grand Son <hi>Maſar,</hi> was the Firſt <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> after the <hi>Deluge.</hi>

                     <hi>Philemon,</hi> the better to eſtabliſh the State of his <hi>Offſpring,</hi> reveal'd to them many Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Things; taught them the <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> of the <hi>Dgebel Pharan,</hi> or the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> with all the Myſteries of the <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> and the <hi>Chymical</hi> Preparations of <hi>Moncatam;</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Waters and Eſſences, Powders and other Ingredients, by which they made Marble as pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as Wax or Clay.

Thus, <hi>Science</hi> became Hereditary to the <hi>Coptites,</hi> who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102963:40"/>bear that Name from <hi>Coptim,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> the Firſt <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſince the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> appear'd in the Clouds. And, 'twas from one of that Race, my Mother learn'd that Admirable <hi>Secret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truſt not to Words, but try the Experiment. The <hi>Receipt</hi> will give thee all Neceſſary Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Yet I counſel thee not to be big with it, like him who having found out the Art of making Glaſs Malleable, or fit to be beat by the Hammer into any Shape or Figure, as the Silver-Smiths work their Metal; muſt needs go and diſcover his <hi>Secret</hi> to the <hi>Prince,</hi> expecting a great Reward. When, on the contrary, he loſt his Head on the Spot; the <hi>Prince</hi> thinking it great Injuſtice, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſand People as got their Bread by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Common Glaſſes, ſhou'd be all ruin'd, to promote one Man's Profit and Advantage.</p>
                  <p>In fine, uſe this <hi>Secret</hi> to ſerve thy ſelf, or the <hi>Cauſe</hi> thou art engag'd in: But truſt it not to another, unleſs on the ſame Equal Terms as I commit it to thee, wherein the greater Hazard is thine in divulging it.</p>

                  <p>WHen I firſt heard of thy Baniſhment from the <hi>Imperial Palace</hi> and City, think not that I was ſad, or entertain'd the uſual Sentiments of a Friend, on ſuch Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

                  <p>When <hi>God</hi> commanded <hi>Noah,</hi> with his Companions, to deſcend out of the <hi>Ark</hi> in Peace, they built them Houſes, and began to exerciſe <hi>Husbandry;</hi> They ſowed <hi>Corn,</hi> and the Seeds of other <hi>Vegetables:</hi> They planted alſo all Sorts of Trees; but when they came to look for the <hi>Vine,</hi> it cou'd not be found. Then it was told <hi>Noah</hi> by the <hi>Angel,</hi> that the <hi>Devil</hi> had ſtollen it away, as having ſome Right to it. Wherefore <hi>Noah</hi> cited the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> to appear before the <hi>Angel,</hi> in the Name
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102963:41"/>of <hi>God,</hi> to anſwer his Theft. The <hi>Angel</hi> gave Judgment, That the <hi>Vine</hi> ſhou'd be divided between 'em into <hi>Three</hi> Parts, whereof the <hi>Devil</hi> ſhou'd have <hi>Two,</hi> and <hi>Noah One:</hi> To which both Parties conſented. Whereby it is evident, that Man has ſome Share in the Juice of the <hi>Grape.</hi> For, this was the Deciſion of <hi>Gabriel,</hi> That when <hi>Two Thirds</hi> of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of this Fruit, ſhou'd be evaporated away in boyling over the Fire, the Remainder ſhou'd be lawful for <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Poſterity</hi> to drink: And thou know'ſt, we <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> generally obey this <hi>Law,</hi> in preparing our <hi>Wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>Devil</hi> therefore, in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> have his Share in this Tempting Fruit, and then there can be no Injuſtice in enjoying our own Part. For, when that which Inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, is ſeparated by Fire from the Reſt, this Liquor becomes pure, holy, and bleſſed. This is the Sentence of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> the Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Auditors of the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as is to be ſeen in the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> they left behind them; which though they are rare and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to be met with, yet ſuch as diligently ſeek Wiſdom, ſhalt not loſe their Labour. <hi>Abu Becre Eb'n Mahumet,</hi> has taken great Pains to collect the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of <hi>Antiquity.</hi> He was a Learned <hi>Doctor</hi> among my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Sulpha,</hi> (may he reſt under the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrella's</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe</hi>) From him I had this Relation.</p>
                  <p>But, tell me, my dear <hi>Mehemet,</hi> if thou know'ſt, how cam'ſt thou to be the only
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102963:42"/>Man that had the good Fortune to be Sentenc'd to this Happy Diſgrace? Or, if thou art Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, I will tell thee. For, it ſeems, the Reſt of thy Company in that Nights-Revel were diſcover'd as well as thou, yet eſcap'd all Cenſure. It looks, as if they were deſignedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd for Victims, to a more Inexorable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. And, the Event juſtifies this Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: Since within the Circuit of a <hi>Moon,</hi> not only they, but all the ſurviving Creatures of the <hi>Sultana Kioſem,</hi> were ſtrangl'd.</p>
                  <p>Therefore again I pronounce thee Happy, and doubly Bleſs'd in being an <hi>Exile,</hi> ſince thereby thou haſt eſcap'd the Hands of the <hi>Executioner,</hi> and art now living in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the moſt Fortunate <hi>Region</hi> on Earth. Aſcribe this to thy <hi>Propitious Deſtiny,</hi> and to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Solyman Kyzlir Aga:</hi> Who foreſeeing the Slaughter that wou'd be made of that Old <hi>Queen</hi>'s Servants, took this Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to accuſe thee to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> that ſo he might ſave thy Life. For, 'twas at his Interceſſion, thou wert baniſh'd into this Happy <hi>Province,</hi> which is call'd the <hi>Nurſe</hi> of all <hi>Nations.</hi> Improve thy <hi>Exile</hi> to the beſt Advantage; and from this <hi>Nurſe,</hi> ſuck the <hi>Milk</hi> of <hi>Science</hi> with which ſhe has formerly Nouriſh'd the Whole Earth. Be grateful alſo to thy <hi>Deliverer;</hi> for, he is a Truſty Friend, and Unchangeable, where he once places his Affection. He had a particular Kindneſs for thee.

                     <hi>Oraiſons</hi> for his Health and Happineſs: Since thou art in a <hi>Land,</hi> where the <hi>Prayers</hi> of <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> are as effectually heard at ſome Particular <hi>Places,</hi> as if they were utter'd at the <hi>Tomb</hi> of the <hi>Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I counſel thee, to viſit the <hi>Priſon</hi> of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which is in the <hi>Dungeon</hi> of the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Caire.</hi> This is a Place of great <hi>Devotion</hi> among the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and has been ſo in all Ages, ſince the Death of that <hi>Patriarch. Moſes</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>that he died in the Embraces of God,</hi> made his <hi>Prayers</hi> in this Place; and ſo did <hi>Aaron</hi> his Brother, when they perform'd thoſe <hi>Miracles</hi> in <hi>Egypt. Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> viſited this Place, both he and his Mother (on whom are center'd the Smiles of the <hi>Creator:</hi>) They there per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd their <hi>Devotions,</hi> when they fled from the Perſecution of <hi>Herod.</hi> So did the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as many as were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> with all <hi>True Believers.</hi> Nay, ſome of the <hi>Infidels</hi> themſelves, having heard of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of this <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> made their <hi>Addreſſes</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> there, in Time of great Diſtreſs. For, here <hi>Prayers</hi> are infallibly heard, eſpecially if they be ſaid after the <hi>Sun</hi> has travers'd the <hi>Meridian;</hi> when the <hi>Wicked Daemons</hi> are aſleep, who walk abroad till <hi>Noon,</hi> doing all the Miſchief they can.</p>
                  <p>My Friend, when I think of the <hi>Region</hi> where thou art, I can hardly forbear envying thee. 'Tis a <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Prodigies</hi> and <hi>Miracles.</hi> It is the Support of Men, and the <hi>Granary</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> Thoſe who Inhabit it, are full

                  <p>There are many ſtrange Things related of the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Alphiom,</hi> and how it was Firſt Manur'd by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> being before his Time but a <hi>Fen</hi> or <hi>Marſh.</hi> The Story alſo of <hi>Hagar,</hi> the Mother of all the <hi>Iſmaelites,</hi> is not Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant; Thou wilt find it in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of <hi>Egypt:</hi> For ſhe was an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> of the <hi>Family</hi> of the <hi>Coptites;</hi> and was beſtow'd on <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Wife of our Father <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> by <hi>Charoba,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Daughter.

                  <p>THou may'ſt report it to the <hi>Divan</hi> for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth, That the <hi>Chief Mufti</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is dead: Which puts all the <hi>Courts</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> upon new Strains of <hi>Policy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was call'd <hi>Innocent</hi> X. after his Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to the <hi>Papacy:</hi> For, his true Name was <hi>Pamphylio.</hi> But ſome ſay, it has been a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom for the <hi>Popes</hi> to change their Names, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince a certain <hi>Prieſt</hi> was lifted to that <hi>Dignity,</hi> who was call'd <hi>Bocca de Porco,</hi> or <hi>Hogs-Face.</hi> He, aſham'd of this Ignominious Name, as ſoon as he ſate in the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> aſſum'd the Name of <hi>Sergius.</hi> Yet, all his <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> have not obſerv'd that Rule.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Popes</hi> have an Authority, greater than our <hi>Principal Mufti.</hi> For, they are obey'd by <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Emperors.</hi> And being eſteem'd little leſs than <hi>Gods</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> they are ſolemnly Ador'd on the Day of their <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation,</hi> by all the <hi>Cardinals, Princes, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> and Foreign <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> at that Time in <hi>Rome.</hi> And, for that End, they are ſeated on the <hi>Altar,</hi> which the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> call, The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Habitation</hi> of their <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I miſtake not in my Obſervations, theſe <hi>Roman Caliphs</hi> aſpire at a <hi>Sovereignty</hi> over all <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes:</hi> They wou'd make that which they call the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> a Superlative
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102963:44"/>Independent <hi>Monarchy,</hi> to which all the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> ſhould pay <hi>Homage,</hi> and be Subject.</p>
                  <p>This puts me in Mind of a certain <hi>Preacher</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> who ſome Years ago, when <hi>Adonai</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> was in that City, and happen'd to be preſent in the <hi>Church,</hi> having made a very Elaborate <hi>Speech</hi> to perſuade the People, That the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were Superiour to <hi>Kings;</hi> at length he broke out into this Paſſionate Exclamation: <hi>O ye Princes of Chriſtendom, ye are Pharaohs, and we Prieſts are your Gods; O ye Pharaohs, obey your Gods! Ye can only command the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but we make the Creator himſelf come down on the Altars, at our Pleaſure.</hi> This Relation I had from the <hi>Jew,</hi> in his <hi>Travels</hi> through <hi>Italy.</hi> And it is aſſerted by ſome of their <hi>Doctors, That the Pope has not only Power to Excommunicate the Greateſt Prince on Earth, but alſo to pull a Saint out of Paradiſe, and ſend him to Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they cou'd perſuade the <hi>Nazarene Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>People</hi> to believe they have ſuch an <hi>Exorbitant Power,</hi> perhaps in Time they might reduce 'em to as blind a <hi>Superſtition,</hi> as the Ancient <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> were Guilty of, who were ſo beſotted to their <hi>Prieſts;</hi> that when he whom they call'd the <hi>Cater,</hi> or <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Celeſtial Influences</hi> commanded the <hi>King</hi> to Kill himſelf, for that it was the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the poor bigotted <hi>Monarch,</hi> durſt not diſpute the Orders he had receiv'd, but in ſimple Obedience became his own Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:102963:45"/>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>Egyptian Prieſts</hi> indeed, were <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of great <hi>Science,</hi> profound <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> Excellent <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> and perfectly skill'd in the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>Natural Magick.</hi> They perform'd Things tranſcending the more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Obvious Works of <hi>Nature:</hi> By which it was eaſy, to ſtrike a Terror into the Hearts of Ignorant Mortals. But, as for theſe <hi>Nazarene Prieſts,</hi> all that they can boaſt of is, that they have read the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of Former Times, and are able to diſcourſe in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and other <hi>Sciences,</hi> without having the Power to work any <hi>Prodigies:</hi> Unleſs thou wilt count it one, To keep ſo many Warlike <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in a Servile Awe of their Authority, with the bare Pretence, of turning a <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> into a <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet for all this, there are many Poor <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,</hi> and other <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> who are inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with Empty Titles, having little or no <hi>Revenues:</hi> Among which, the Poverty of ſome is ſo Remarkable, as to become a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.</hi> Thus, 'tis Common in the Mouths of the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſay, <hi>The Pope's Mule fares better than the Biſhop of Orvietto.</hi>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimacham.</head>
                  <p>I Believe, the <hi>Secretary</hi> of the <hi>Nazarene</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs takes me to be a <hi>Conjurer,</hi> and thinks that I can divine of all the Changes and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations that happen at the <hi>Port,</hi> or that I have ſome <hi>Magical</hi> Glaſs, which repreſents to me the continued <hi>Series</hi> of remote Events, with all the Tranſactions of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court, Camp, and City: Or elſe he wou'd not be ſo late in his <hi>Diſpatches,</hi> and ſend me ſuch Imperfect News. I am forc'd many Times, to addreſs my Letters by Gueſs; not knowing, whether the Perſon to whom I write be in the ſame <hi>Station</hi> he was a while ago, or whether he be among the <hi>Living,</hi> or the <hi>Dead:</hi> Whether I ſhou'd direct my <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or to the <hi>Elyzian Shades.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Intelligence of the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Affairs, is many Times more oweing to the <hi>French</hi> Merchants who trade in the <hi>Levant,</hi> or to the <hi>Expreſſes</hi> which come from <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> than to that <hi>Secretary;</hi> whoſe Care it ought to be, that I ſhou'd be timely inform'd of whatever happens in the <hi>Oſman Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, <hi>Kiſur Dramelec</hi> has ſome Deſign upon me, in being always thus tardy and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent. I ſcarce hear from him once in half a
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102963:46"/>Year; whereas he is commanded by <hi>his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours</hi> as well as <hi>mine,</hi> to write to me every <hi>Moon.</hi> And then, he ſends me ſuch a Lame Account of Things, ſuch Fragments and Scraps of News, that his Letters need a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to make 'em Intelligible.</p>
                  <p>About Four Years ago, I modeſtly tax'd him with this Neglect, when I had Reaſon to do it in my own Vindication, to <hi>Minezim Aluph, Baſſa.</hi> But <hi>Kiſur</hi> heard of it, and was very Angry. He ſent me a Letter, full of Invectives, which I anſwer'd with a Kind of Indifference, mixing Raillery with my Juſter Reſentments. How that work'd on him, I know not; but his Reſervedneſs ever ſince, makes me conclude he ſtudies Revenge; and that he takes this Method to accompliſh it, by keeping me as much in Ignorance, as he dares, of the Changes and other Important Occurrences at the <hi>Myſterious Port.</hi> He knows it wou'd be a Crime little leſs than Capital, not to write to me at all: Such a wilful Contumacy wou'd ſtreight proclaim him a <hi>Traytor;</hi> ſince, among the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which were given him with his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> this Charge was none of the leaſt, That he ſhou'd ſend frequent Intelligence to all the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s <hi>Agents,</hi> whether Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Private, in the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Nazarene Princes.</hi> He is ſenſible, That ſuch a Manifeſt Contempt of <hi>Supreme Authority,</hi> wou'd abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ruine him. Therefore he goes more ſubtilly to work. For, he writes indeed, but, very ſeldom. And then, with cunning
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102963:46"/>Artifice, either quite conceals, or at leaſt diſguiſes the moſt conſiderable Tranſactions, only filling up his Letters with Trifling Stories, and Impertinent Relations, nothing to my Purpoſe: Thinking by this Means, to bring upon me the Diſpleaſure of the <hi>Grandees,</hi> through the Miſtakes I may commit, for Want of better Advertiſement.</p>
                  <p>Be it how it will, I am ſtrangely at a Loſs ſometimes, what to think, or how to write to my <hi>Superiours;</hi> or what Sort of Conduct I ſhou'd uſe in this Place, amidſt ſo many Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reports as are continually ſpread abroad in <hi>Europe,</hi> concerning the Affairs of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi> the <hi>Shining City,</hi> and other <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman Empire:</hi> Whilſt this <hi>Kiſur</hi> ſtill delays to aſcertain me of any Thing.</p>
                  <p>I have been wholly a Stranger, till within theſe few Days, to the Fate of the <hi>Captain Baſſa,</hi> who was ſtrangled about a Year ago, for his Cowardiſe and Ill Conduct againſt the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Neither knew I any Thing of the Adventure and Flight of his Sons. I was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Ignorant of the Succeſſion of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> in this Important <hi>Command;</hi> and of many other changes both by <hi>Land,</hi> and <hi>Sea.</hi>

                  <p>So at preſent, here are a Thouſand Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours ſtirring about one Thing or other in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> Some ſay, that <hi>Chuſaein Baſſa</hi> is ſtrangl'd, and that the <hi>Captain Baſſa,</hi> is made <hi>Vizir Azem</hi> in his Stead. Others report, that this <hi>Firſt Miniſter</hi> was only depos'd from that <hi>Supreme Dignity,</hi> the <hi>Seals</hi> being taken
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102963:47"/>from him; but that nevertheleſs, he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Forces in <hi>Candia.</hi> A Third Sort affirm, that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to turn <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> holding a ſecret Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> by whoſe Means, and a General Revolt of the <hi>Greeks, Armenians,</hi> and other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Juriſdiction, he ſought to betray the <hi>Ottoman Blood,</hi> and exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not willing to believe, that ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Perfidy, cou'd enter into the Heart of that Illuſtrious <hi>Hero;</hi> yet know not how to contradict it, for Want of true Advice.</p>
                  <p>It is reported alſo, That <hi>Signior Capello,</hi> the <hi>Venetian Bailo</hi> or <hi>Reſident,</hi> at the <hi>Happy Port,</hi> has kill'd himſelf with a Ponyard: Being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Deſpair, by his long Confinement, and the cruel Uſage he had receiv'd from the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans. God</hi> knows whether it be true or no. It wou'd be much to my Satisfaction, to have a particular Account of all theſe Things, and of whatſoever elſe occurs worthy of Notice. For, how can I diſcharge my Truſt, whilſt I am thus kept in the Dark.</p>
                  <p>They talk here of a Violent <hi>Plague</hi> that rages in <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> and that above 200000 Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have died of it in the City of <hi>Moſco</hi> only, beſides Millions that have been ſwept away in the <hi>Provinces</hi> of that Vaſt <hi>Empire.</hi> Thoſe that really know not <hi>themſelves,</hi> nor are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their <hi>own Nature,</hi> will yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to penetrate into the <hi>Counſels</hi> of the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,</hi> and pronounce this as a <hi>Judgment</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:102963:47"/>on the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> for the Cruelties they have committed in <hi>Poland.</hi> Doubtleſs, the <hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>Fate</hi> are <hi>Inſcrutable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean While, we are plagu'd here with a Crew of <hi>Vagabonds,</hi> whom they call <hi>Gypſies,</hi> or <hi>Egyptians:</hi> For, they pretend to be deſcended from that Place. They ſwarm up and down the Country like <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> devouring the Fruits of the Earth. They boaſt of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Skill in <hi>Palmeſtry, Phyſiognomy,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sciences,</hi> cheating People of their Money, under the Notion of telling them their <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi> No Body knows from whence they come, or whither they go. For, they are as uncertain as the Wind. A Naſty Generation, and the very Burden of the Land. If any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be oblig'd to them, 'tis the <hi>Mice</hi> and <hi>Rats,</hi> with whom they ſeem to be in League. For, they Kill and Eat all the <hi>Cats</hi> they ſeize on.</p>
                  <p>Illuſtrious <hi>Miniſter,</hi> I pray <hi>Heaven</hi> defend thee from all Sorts of <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Vermin,</hi> but eſpecially from <hi>Monſters</hi> in <hi>Human Shape.</hi>

                  <p>AS I am alive, theſe <hi>Gypſies</hi> have enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me; I cannot put 'em out of my Mind. And, perhaps, it will neither be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent nor troubleſome, to give thee a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Information of them.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral Opinions concerning the <hi>Original</hi> of theſe <hi>Vagrants,</hi> and they have been thought worthy to be inſerted into <hi>Hiſtories.</hi> Some ſay, they came out of <hi>Tartary</hi> or <hi>Scythia,</hi> and that they firſt appear'd in theſe <hi>Parts,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year 1417. of the <hi>Chriſtians Hegira.</hi> At which Time, they enter'd into <hi>Saxony</hi> in Troops, having the <hi>Paſsport</hi> of <hi>Sigiſmund King</hi> of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and Son of <hi>Charles</hi> IV. They had alſo the Recommendations of divers other <hi>Princes,</hi> who look'd on them as <hi>Holy Perſons</hi> or <hi>Prophets.</hi> For they pretended, that they were commanded by <hi>God,</hi> to travel over the Whole Earth, and not to have either Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Lands in their own Poſſeſſion: And, that this was enjoin'd 'em as a <hi>Penance,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate the <hi>Sin</hi> of their <hi>Anceſtors;</hi> who inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Egypt</hi> in the Days of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians Meſſias,</hi> refus'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain that <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> and his <hi>Mother,</hi> when they fled from the <hi>Perſecution</hi> of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod.</hi>

                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:102963:48"/>
                  <p>Others are of Opinion, that they came firſt out of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and are of the <hi>Race</hi> of thoſe who Adore the <hi>Fire.</hi> Being forc'd once in Seven Years, to make <hi>Decimations</hi> of their <hi>People,</hi> and ſend away many <hi>Caravans,</hi> to ſeek their Fortune in <hi>Foreign Countries; Perſia</hi> not being able to ſuſtain their Numerous <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Third Sort affirm, That they are the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity</hi> of the <hi>Ten Jewiſh Tribes,</hi> that were carried away Captives by <hi>Salamanaſſar, King</hi> of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> No Body knows for certain what they are, or of whence. They are of ſwarthy Complexions, wrapt up in Mantles of Cotton or Wool. They ſpeak Seven <hi>Languages,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Three <hi>Sciences,</hi> obey One <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> who always travels with 'em.

The <hi>Germans</hi> call them <hi>Zingener,</hi> from the Word <hi>Zindel,</hi> which is the conſtant Appellative of the <hi>King</hi> of theſe <hi>Ramblers;</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was of Old among the <hi>Gypſies,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans.</hi> In many Things they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the <hi>Torlakins</hi> and <hi>Faquirs</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> boaſting of extraordinary Illuminations, and a conſtant Familiarity with <hi>God:</hi> Tho' ſome Learned Men among the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> eſteem 'em no better than a Crew of Cheats and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites: Even as they do thoſe <hi>Oriental San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tones;</hi> who, they ſay, under the Maſque of

                     <hi>God</hi> beſt knows, what Judgment is to be made either of the <hi>One</hi> or the <hi>Other.</hi> But theſe <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as they call 'em, whether they are really ſuch, or no, have no great Marks of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> in that they are very <hi>

                  <p>As to the <hi>Faquirs</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> they are ſtrict Obſervers of the <hi>Law</hi> of Abſtinence and Cleanneſs; whether they be <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> or the <hi>Gentiles</hi> of <hi>India.</hi> And if in other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they may be found faulty, 'tis very rare: And then they exceed not the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Humanity,</hi> which thou know'ſt, is by <hi>Nature</hi> prone to <hi>Error,</hi> and ſubject to a Thouſand Frailties and Overſights. We are all Men, and <hi>God</hi> does not expect our Conduct to be that of <hi>Angels.</hi> His Repoſe is in himſelf; and if he takes any Complacency in the Things of the World, 'tis in beholding every Thing act according to its <hi>Nature.</hi> The exquiſite Form and Symmetry of a <hi>Bee,</hi> a <hi>Spider,</hi> or a <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,</hi> with the Inimitable Architecture of the Two Former, and the Admirable Providence of the Latter, may, for ought we know, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford him as much Delight, as the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Beauty, Strength, Science, and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of Men. For, his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> are Equally manifeſt in All Things. Every
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102963:49"/>
                     <hi>Creature</hi> is <hi>Perfect</hi> in its <hi>Kind,</hi> onely a <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is a <hi>Blot</hi> in the <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou know what the <hi>Weſtern Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarenes</hi> are moſt buſie about at this Time? 'Tis the <hi>Election</hi> of a New <hi>Pope.</hi> He is to be choſen by the <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> who are <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> They are all ſhut up in a Place, which they call the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave.</hi> This is a certain <hi>Gallery</hi> in the <hi>Palace</hi> of the <hi>Vatican</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> where every <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> has his <hi>Cell</hi> or <hi>Apartment</hi> by himſelf, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving onely Two Servants to attend him. The <hi>Conclave</hi> is ſurrounded by the <hi>Roman Militia,</hi> to prevent all Intercourſe by Letters, or other Ways, between thoſe without, and thoſe within. The very Diſhes which are ſerv'd up at the Tables of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> are narrowly ſearch'd, leſt any Letters ſhou'd be convey'd in them. The laſt Poſts from <hi>Rome</hi> aſſure us, That there were no leſs than 66 <hi>Cardinals</hi> thus ſhut up, when they left that City. And, there they muſt remain Night and Day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking the freſh Air, or ſeeing any Body, till they have agreed in their <hi>Election.</hi> There are Two <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> and an <hi>Apothecary</hi> ſhut up with 'em, to ſerve'em in Caſe of Sickneſs.</p>
                  <p>One of the <hi>Conclaviſts</hi> is the <hi>Cardinal de Retz,</hi> who eſcap'd out of his Priſon in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and fled to <hi>Rome</hi> for Protection. From whence he ſent a Letter to the <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> and other <hi>Prelates</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pronounc'd a <hi>Seditious Libel</hi> againſt the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Government,</hi> was in the End of the laſt <hi>Moon</hi> burnt publickly by the <hi>King</hi>'s
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102963:50"/>Order, and all <hi>Copies</hi> of it prohibited.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> has alſo ſent private Inſtructions to the <hi>Cardinals</hi> of his Party at <hi>Rome,</hi> to keep a ſtrict Watch on the Conduct of <hi>de Retz,</hi> and to oppoſe him in all Things.</p>
                  <p>Here is nothing but Caballing and Intrigue among theſe <hi>Infidels:</hi> They are good at a Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, and know better how to undermine one another, than to face their Enemies in the open Field: Which is a Character more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Women than Men. Whereas thou know'ſt, our <hi>Hero's</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> know no other Way to Honour, Victory and Empire, than by downright Bravery and Reſolution, ſubduing all Things by the Force of their Arms. But <hi>God,</hi> when he divided the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and ſeparated the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> aſſign'd to every one a different <hi>Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> according to whoſe <hi>Influence,</hi> the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of each People is diſpos'd. They all obey the <hi>Dictates</hi> of their <hi>Particular Stars,</hi> and the <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Eternal Deſtiny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore; Sage <hi>Miniſter,</hi> ſince <hi>Mars</hi> is the <hi>Planet</hi> of the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> there is no Need, that we ſhou'd turn <hi>Apoſtates</hi> from the <hi>Star</hi> of our <hi>better Fortune,</hi> to court the <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> who is onely the <hi>Guardian</hi> of <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Cheats.</hi>

                  <p>FOrmerly I cou'd have writ to thee with as much Freedom, as I cou'd to <hi>Egri Boinou,</hi> (on whom reſt the Favours of <hi>God</hi>) or as I can now to <hi>Gnet Oglou,</hi> to my Brother <hi>Peſteli Hali,</hi> or to any of my Familiar Friends. But when I conſider the Eminent <hi>Station</hi> thou poſſeſſeſt, in that the Health and Life of the <hi>Mighty Emperor</hi> is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102963:51"/>now committed to thy Skill and Care, I am many Times at a Stand how to addreſs my ſelf. Methinks, thou art tinctur'd with the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of that <hi>Perſonage,</hi> whoſe Hand thou ſo often haſt the Honour to touch, when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to diſcover by the beating of his <hi>Pulſe,</hi> the Interiour Maladies which afflict his <hi>Royal Soul.</hi> Yet I know thou ſtill retaineſt thy Humanity, and wilt not deſpiſe thoſe whom thou haſt once thought worthy of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>Suffer me then to converſe with a <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick</hi> Freedom, that is, in an Addreſs void of Formalities and Reſerves.</p>
                  <p>I know 'tis of no Import, whether <hi>Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut</hi> be ſick or well, provided the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> be ſerv'd. What ſignifie the Languiſhing Pains, or more Acute Agonies of a <hi>Slave,</hi> ſo long as he is able to carry on his <hi>Maſter</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt?

Every Man owes Something to his <hi>Relations,</hi> more to his <hi>Friends,</hi> but moſt of all to the <hi>Publick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore I make no Complaints of my <hi>Lot,</hi> nor murmur at the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny.</hi> I accuſe not the <hi>Stars</hi> of my <hi>Nativity,</hi> nor tax 'em with Unkindly <hi>Aſpects:</hi> But am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with my Fortune, be it Good or Bad, and reſign'd to the Pleaſure of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>Nature</hi> has fram'd my Body Infirm and Weak, ſubject to a Thouſand Maladies; So is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102963:51"/>my Mind alſo haraſs'd with Diſtempers which have no Number. But above all, I labour under a Kind of <hi>Intellectual Fever,</hi> a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Thirſt of Knowledge, which all the Books and Converſe in the World cannot ſatisfie. There is no End of my Doubts and Scruples. Every Thing appears to me as Ambiguous, as the <hi>Anſwers</hi> of the <hi>Delphic Oracle.</hi> Nay, I am a perfect Riddle to my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Tell me, dear <hi>Hali,</hi> how I ſhall cure this <hi>Dropſy</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> and I will not trouble thee with the Inconſiderable Diſeaſes of my <hi>Body.</hi> I have a high Opinion of you <hi>Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> And ſhall put more Confidence in thy Advice, than in the <hi>Tefta</hi> of the <hi>Mufti.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal not thy Art from <hi>Mahmut,</hi> who admires thee with a Reſpect equal to that which he pays to the Memories of <hi>Avicen, Al' Razi, Helal,</hi> and the Reſt of thoſe excellent <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> mention'd in our <hi>Arabian Hiſtories.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now theſe Ornaments of our <hi>Nation</hi> are come into my Mind, permit them to divert me from ſaying or thinking any more of my ſelf at preſent: For it will be better to turn the Diſcourſe to ſuch Illuſtrious Themes. At worſt, it will be but an Innocent Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>In peruſing the <hi>Lives</hi> of thoſe Famous Men, I meet with ſome Paſſages which are very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. Perhaps thou haſt ſeen the ſame. Yet 'twill do thee no Hurt, to call 'em again to thy Remembrance.</p>
                  <p>I have read in a certain <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> penn'd by <hi>Ibrahim</hi> the Son of <hi>Helal,</hi> a Renown'd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102963:52"/>
                     <hi>Phyſician</hi> at <hi>Badgat,</hi> this <hi>Memoir</hi> of his Father. <q>On a certain Day, ſays he, that my Father had adminiſtred Phyſick to the <hi>Emperor Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zun,</hi> for which he was preſented with a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Veſt,</hi> rewarded with Five Thouſand <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and by the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Command was carried through the Streets in State, I obſerv'd that he was Penſive amidſt all thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and troubled in Mind, when I thought he had greateſt Reaſon to rejoice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid to him, <hi>My Father, How comes it to paſs, that you are thus dejected, at a Time when all the World expects to ſee you diſſolv'd in Pleaſure?</hi> He anſwer'd, <hi>Son, He that has beſtow'd theſe Honours on me is a Fool, and does things prepoſterouſly without Reaſon. And therefore I cannot rejoice at theſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Favours he has ſhew'd me, being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible they are not the Effects of his Judgment, but of his Ignorance. I gave him a Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Potion, which work'd ſo ſtrongly with him, that it excoriated his Bowels, and brought forth Blood. So that I was forc'd to uſe a different Method, both to remove his Diſtemper, and ſtop the Violent Flux. In the mean while, he Ignorantly believing, That the Voiding of ſo much Blood, procur'd him the preſent Eaſe and Health he feels, therefore order'd theſe Honours to be done me which thou ſeeſt. Now that which ſaddens me, is my Fear, leſt ſome Time or other, he may through his Ignorance commit as great an Error on the Contrary Side, and ſuſpect that I have done him an Injury, when there is no Ground for it, and ſo put me to Death.</hi>

                  <p>Tell me, my Friend, had not this <hi>Phyſician</hi> Reaſon for his Behaviour and Words? He was a Man of Great Abilities, accompliſh'd with divers <hi>Sciences,</hi> and in high Eſteem with the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> of <hi>Arabia.</hi>

When he was at a Loſs in any Diſquiſition, he us'd to frequent the <hi>Moſques,</hi> and pour forth Devout and Fervent <hi>Oraiſons</hi> to the <hi>Source</hi> of <hi>Intellectual Lights,</hi> till the Thing was manifeſted to him. He ſate up late a-Nights, having a Lamp perpetually burning in his Chamber, applying himſelf attentively to Books and Contemplation.

Wherefore, when I had him alone, I ſaid, <hi>My dear</hi> Thabet, <hi>The Study of Phyſick is Common to us both; therefore hide nothing from me, but diſcover freely by what Art you were able to tell, That the Poet eat ſowr Milk with Veal, and not as well with Beef or Mutton; and that the Aſtrologer eat no more nor leſs than Eleven Pomegranates?</hi> He anſwer'd, <hi>My Mind ſuggeſted this to me, and prompted my Tongue to utter it.</hi> Then I deſir'd him to ſhew me the <hi>Scheme</hi> of his <hi>Nativity:</hi> Which he did at his own Houſe. And conſidering it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, I obſerv'd, That the Planet <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> was <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Horoſcope.</hi> Then I ſaid to him, <hi>'Tis this ſpeaks, my Dear Friend, not you, ſo often as you make theſe Fortunate Conjectures.</hi>

                     <hi>God</hi> knows, whether the <hi>Stars</hi> have any ſuch <hi>Influence</hi> on Men in their <hi>Birth,</hi> or no. I am not very Credulous in this Point.

                  </p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:102963:54"/>
                  <p>In the <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>Cheuval,</hi> a certain Citizen of <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> was accus'd before the <hi>Elector</hi> for hunting in his Foreſt, and killing one of his <hi>Deer.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> in a Rage, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be ſet upon a <hi>Stag,</hi> his Hands chain'd to the Horns, and his Feet under the Belly of the Beaſt; ordering, that the <hi>Stag</hi> with this Burden, ſhou'd be let looſe to run whither he wou'd. The poor frighten'd <hi>Stag,</hi> not being accuſtom'd to ſuch a Load, and terrified with the rattling of the Chain, ran away full ſpeed over Hills and Dales, through Thickets of Briars and Thorns, never ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping till it had meaſur'd above Three and Thirty <hi>German</hi> Leagues; and then, tyr'd with ſo vaſt a Race, he fell down. At which Inſtant, a <hi>Caravan</hi> was coming by that Place, out of <hi>Sileſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The poor Wretch on the Back of the <hi>Stag,</hi> almoſt dead with the Pains he had undergone, in ſo continued and violent a Motion, being alſo ſorely bruis'd and his Fleſh torn and mangl'd by the Boughs of Trees, as the <hi>Stag</hi> ruſh'd through thick Woods; cry'd aloud to the <hi>Caravan,</hi> begging that ſome of them wou'd in Mercy diſpatch him out of his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But they, either for fear of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Diſpleaſure, or for other Reaſons, refus'd him this Kindneſs. So that after the <hi>Stag</hi> had reſted a-while, and recovered new Spirits, he began a freſh Career; and never ceas'd running, till he arriv'd at a certain <hi>Monaſtery</hi> or <hi>Convent</hi> of <hi>Religious,</hi> where he beat againſt the Gate with his Horns, till ſome of the <hi>Derviſes</hi> open'd
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102963:55"/>it, and let him in. They aſtoniſh'd to ſee a Man thus pinion'd to a <hi>Stag,</hi> his Face, Arms, Legs and all his Body cover'd with Blood, and himſelf ready to expire, immediately brought him <hi>Cordials</hi> and other Refreſhments, whilſt ſome were employ'd in looſing his Chains. But being inform'd by his own Mouth, how he came into this Condition, they began to think of turning him looſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for Fear of the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Anger. However, ſuffering themſelves to be overcome by the Importunity of the Miſerable Man, and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> Privileges (for here in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> the <hi>Convents</hi> are generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> for all Sorts of Offenders) they took him into their Protection: But he expir'd that Night.</p>
                  <p>It is hard to determine whether the <hi>Duke,</hi> or theſe <hi>Derviches,</hi> were in the Right or Wrong. The <hi>French,</hi> who of late, have by a Faſhion learn'd to grow Obdurate, juſtifie the Proceedings of this <hi>Prince;</hi> ſaying, That Pity is a Paſſion fit onely for Women, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Fools. They eſteem it a Mark of a Great Spirit, a Mind capable of <hi>Empire,</hi> not to be mov'd with the Sighs or Tears of the Miſerable; but to frown or laugh, at the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of others. This, they ſay, is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Method to harden Men for War, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and Plunder: Where the Victors are to cut their Way to Honour and Riches, through the Hearts of the Vanquiſh'd, to quench the ardent Thirſt of Glory with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Blood, and to celebrate their Triumphs,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102963:55"/>onely in the midſt of horrid Maſſacres and Funerals.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, theſe Principles and Actions are allowable in <hi>Men</hi> of the <hi>Sword,</hi> when they fight the Battels of their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> in Heat of Blood. But, Clemency and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, are Vertues becoming the Greateſt <hi>Prince,</hi> or moſt Valiant <hi>General,</hi> when their Enemies are reduc'd, by the Fortune of War, to kiſs the Duſt of their Feet, and beg for Mercy: Or, when in Time of Peace, their <hi>Subjects</hi> fall into a Crime which may admit of Indulgence. Certainly, theſe <hi>Weſtern In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels</hi> have wrong Notions of Humanity, in aſſerting, That Cruelty is either a Sign of a Noble Nature, or a Step to true Happineſs: Since, the moſt hard-hearted <hi>Tyrant,</hi> one Time or other, will have Need of Compaſſion himſelf; eſpecially in Sickneſs and the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Death, which perhaps prove more tormenting to him, than to the Merciful and Generous. It is recorded of <hi>Al Hejai Eb'n Heſha'm,</hi> a Famous <hi>Abrabian</hi> Captain, that when, in a <hi>Malignant Fever,</hi> he call'd for Water to drink, and it was deny'd him by the <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> who had Care of his Health; <hi>It is enough,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>Rueno'ddaula, once my Lieutenant, to whom I forgave Three Treaſons, and who died a Natural Death, has refreſhed me at this Minute with a Liquor unknown: Sure, 'tis the Wine of Paradiſe.</hi> And from that Moment he began to recover his Health, after which he liv'd many Years, often rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Paſſage among his Familar Friends to his Laſt Day.</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:102963:56"/>
                  <p>But the <hi>Infidels</hi> are either Ignorant of theſe Examples, or if they know 'em, Pride will not ſuffer 'em to learn Morality and Juſtice. They are deſtin'd, the greateſt Part, to be Incredulous to the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment.</hi> How many <hi>Prophets</hi> has <hi>God</hi> ſent into all <hi>Nations,</hi> to teach them the Right Way, and not the Way of ſuch with whom he is diſpleas'd; yet they will not be Converted? They look on the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of the <hi>Eternal,</hi> with the Eyes of <hi>Swine;</hi> They grunt under the Burden of their Senſuality, and like thoſe Filthy Animals, return to their Mire again. Yet, that <hi>Superlatively Merciful,</hi> winks at their Frailties, and viſits them with his <hi>Graces</hi> every Morning. But, they put their Fingers in their Ears, and turn away in Diſdain, as from a Beggar. They reject the <hi>King</hi> of All Things, as a Fugitive and Vagabond on Earth.</p>
                  <p>From that Delectable <hi>Eſſence,</hi> the Odour of whoſe Sweetneſs is diffus'd through the <hi>Elements,</hi> and refreſhes the Minds of the <hi>True Faithful;</hi> let us by continual Devotion and Vertue, attract Divine Tinctures, till our Hearts be all tranform'd into <hi>Incenſe,</hi> and in this Aromatick Pile, our <hi>Souls</hi> expire like the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> to revive again in the Joys of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> in Amours which know no End.</p>

                  <p>I Wonder at Nothing: Much leſs, at the Extravagant Caprices of <hi>Tyrants.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, there appears no Novelty in Modern Tranſactions. They are but a Repetition of Ancient Practices, under New Forms. Of all the Events in this Age, not one has come to my Knowledge which gives me a Surprize. Yet, I muſt confeſs, there is Something very Singular in the Puniſhment the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony</hi> inflicted, as thy Letter tells me, on the poor <hi>Deer</hi>-Stealer. And, if it be juſt to put a Man to Death on ſuch an Account, as the <hi>Indians</hi> hold; the <hi>Duke</hi> ſeems very Ingenious and Accurate, in the Choice he made of an <hi>Executioner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> had a <hi>Law,</hi> which they call'd <hi>Lex Talionis.</hi> Which in all <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> Caſes, appointed the Puniſhment to be in ſome Circumſtances Adequate to the Fault. And thou know'ſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> your <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> left much the ſame <hi>Statutes:</hi> Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Loſs of the Eye of him, who had put another Man's out; a Tooth for a Tooth, an Arm for an Arm, and ſo proportionably of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Injuries. But this <hi>Prince</hi> ſeems to have made a Supplement, where theſe <hi>Laws</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102963:57"/>ſhort; and has ſhew'd a moſt Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Niceneſs of Revenge, in the Deſtiny of the Unfortunate Huntſman, to cauſe a <hi>Stag</hi> to be, in ſo peculiar a Manner, the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Death, who had villainouſly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd one of the ſame <hi>Species.</hi> Doubtleſs, it was a <hi>Princely</hi> Freak of Juſtice: And had it been done purely to avenge the Blood of the ſlaughter'd Beaſt, and not in Vindication of his own Right, I cou'd not forbear to pronounce it a Frolick worthy of a <hi>Hero.</hi> But, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is frequently guilty of the ſame Kind of Murder, as are moſt of the <hi>Great Men</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> whoſe Tables are no other than the <hi>Altars</hi> of <hi>Gluttony,</hi> ſmoaking with Fleſh and Blood, whilſt <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of Animals are there ſacrific'd to Voracious Appetites, the <hi>Idols</hi> of theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> People.</p>
                  <p>Methinks therefore, it had been more Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and becoming a <hi>Prince,</hi> to pardon the Poor Fellow a Theft, which perhaps was the onely Method he had to preſerve <hi>himſelf</hi> and his <hi>Family</hi> from ſtarving. And for ought I know, he had as much Right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> to kill a <hi>Stag,</hi> as the Owner has. But, there is no Talk to be made of Right or Wrong, where Power over-rules all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>India</hi> is at Preſent the onely Publick Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of Juſtice toward all Living Creatures. There, it is a Capital Crime to ſhed the Blood of any Animal, and puniſh'd with Death no Ieſs than the Murder of a Man. The <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> indeed encloſe <hi>Deer</hi> and other
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102963:57"/>Innocent Creatures in Parks, not with a Deſign to prey upon them at their Pleaſure, but to defend 'em from the Violence of others; whilſt thoſe happy Animals range and feed where they pleaſe within thoſe Pales, free from Peril, and never fearing any other Death, ſave what they pay to <hi>Nature,</hi> when they have ſpun out the accuſtom'd Term of their Life. They alſo build Hoſpitals for a like Purpoſe. And are at a great Charge every Year, to redeem a certain Number of Oxen and Cows from Slaughter. For they eſteem it a Barbarous and Inhuman Cruelty, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe Creatures, which are the Nurſes of our Life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if I miſtake not, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges all of thy <hi>Nation</hi> to certain Specifick Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſes towards the Dumb Animals. And <hi>Eeſa</hi> the <hi>Prophet,</hi> a Man of no Obſcure Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, but of a Noted Race among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> ſays <hi>He that killeth an Ox, is as if he ſlew a Man, and he that ſacrificeth a Lamb, as if he beheaded a Dog.</hi> And in another Place, the ſame <hi>Prophet</hi> ſays, in the Perſon of <hi>God, To what Purpoſe is the Multitude of your Sacrifices to me? I am offended with the Smoak of your Burnt-Offerings, and nauſeated with the Smell of broiled Fat. I take no Delight in the Blood of Bulls, Lambs or Goats. Who hath required theſe Things at your Hands? Bring no more vain Oblations, which my Soul hateth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe Expreſſions one wou'd think, the <hi>Prophet</hi> brings in <hi>God,</hi> denying that ever he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102963:58"/>commanded any ſuch <hi>Sacrifices</hi> or ſhedding of Blood, and proteſting againſt it, as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination. Where then is the Reputation of thoſe <hi>Writings</hi> which go under the Name of <hi>Moſes?</hi> For, in them theſe Bloody <hi>Victims</hi> are expreſsly enjoined. <hi>God</hi> cannot be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to himſelf. Doubtleſs, a great Part of the <hi>True Law</hi> which <hi>God</hi> gave to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> was loſt in the Former <hi>Captivities</hi> of your <hi>Nation,</hi> when your Cities and Provinces were quite diſpeopl'd, your Fathers led away by the Victorious <hi>Monarchs</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and your choiceſt <hi>Memoirs</hi> Aboliſh'd. So that what remains now, is only a Collection of Fragments patch'd up by <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and other Induſtrious <hi>Scribes,</hi> to which they gave the Specious Title of the <hi>Law of Moſes,</hi> that ſo they might faſten the wavering People in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, to ſomething, tho' of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing.</p>

                  <p>THeſe <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> like the <hi>Followers</hi> of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> are divided into Innumerable <hi>Sects;</hi> and ſo 'tis in all <hi>Religions.</hi> Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think alike. <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf delights in Variety. <hi>God</hi> has diverſify'd the <hi>Faculties</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> as he has the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of our <hi>Bodies.</hi> The <hi>Zealot,</hi> is ſubject to <hi>Choler;</hi> the <hi>Bigot,</hi> to <hi>Melancholy;</hi> the <hi>Libertine,</hi> is of a <hi>Sanguine</hi> Complexion; and as for the Reſt, they are but ſo many Walking, Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lumps of <hi>Flegm.</hi> This is the <hi>Phyſical</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of <hi>Mortals:</hi> Under which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, the Various <hi>Tempers</hi> which reſult from the different Mixture of theſe Four <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Principles.</hi> And for this, we muſt thank <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, if we conſult the <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> they will aſſign as many different <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Complexions,</hi> as there be <hi>Stars</hi> in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> at leaſt, as there be <hi>Conſtellations.</hi> They'll tell ye of the <hi>Bull</hi> and the <hi>Bear,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> knows what <hi>Heavenly</hi> Stories. The <hi>Dragon</hi> ſhall ſpit Venom on one Man's <hi>Nativity,</hi> out of his Mouth; and give another a poiſonous Lick with his Tail. If we believe all they ſay, there is not an Herb in the Field, but has its particular <hi>Star,</hi> whoſe <hi>Influence</hi> cauſes it to grow and proſper: tho' <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102963:59"/>all the <hi>Vegetables</hi> appear'd on the Earth, even before the <hi>Stars</hi> themſelves had their Exiſtence in the <hi>Heavens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, whether there be any Truth in <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> or no; this is certain, that Men differ in their Sentiments of <hi>Religion,</hi> as they do in their Faces. The <hi>Phyſiognomy</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> is Infinitely various. One Man believes in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Another in <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> a Third in <hi>Mahomet</hi> our <hi>Holy Lawgiver.</hi> Then, theſe are ſubdivided into Innumerable Parties. The <hi>Jews</hi> have Seventy Eminent <hi>Religious Factions.</hi> There are number'd Seventy and One <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and Seventy Two of <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Theſe are all at Odds about Words and <hi>Exteriour Ceremonies;</hi> ſo Zealous for Charity and Peace, that they are in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wars for its Sake, murdering one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Love of <hi>God:</hi> And ſuch ſtout Champions for the <hi>Truth,</hi> that they ſcruple not to tell Ten Thouſand Lyes in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
                  <p>The Differences between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian Nazarenes,</hi> the <hi>Neſtorians</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites,</hi> with other <hi>Sects</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> are not unknown to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port.</hi> But perhaps thou art a Stranger to the Newer <hi>Schiſms</hi> of the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt Eminent <hi>Diviſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> at this Time, is into <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</hi> The Former obey the <hi>Roman Mufti,</hi> and boaſt of an Uninterrupted <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Caliphs</hi> from <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Vicar</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> down to the preſent <hi>Pope.</hi> The Latter are the <hi>Followers</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:102963:59"/>of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> Men who pretended to certain <hi>New Lights,</hi> and claim'd a Right to reform the <hi>Errors</hi> of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip. God</hi> beſt knows, who's in the Right or Wrong, of theſe Two <hi>Parties:</hi> But, they have always been at Daggers-drawing in Defence of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Tenets;</hi> perſecuting and maſſacring one another, for <hi>Conſcience</hi>-Sake. Both Sides appeal to the <hi>Written Law,</hi> to <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Traditions,</hi> to the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi> the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> and the Practice of thoſe whom they call the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church.</hi> Yet neither Part will allow the other a Sufficient Judgment to Interpret thoſe <hi>Memoirs</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> nor an Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Power to decide Controverſies of this Nature. Thus their Diſputes are like to laſt, till the <hi>Final Day</hi> of <hi>Deciſion,</hi> when all Human Quarrels ſhall be determin'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Grand Tribunal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean Time they take all Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, to execute their Spight and Malice on each other, under the Notion of Juſtice and Piety. We are daily alarm'd here with Tragical Relations of horrid Murders and Butcheries, committed on the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and other Parts under the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Whilſt ſome ſay, That all theſe Reports are falſe, and the Sufferings of thoſe People are according to <hi>Law,</hi> the due Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their <hi>Rebellious</hi> Actions.</p>
                  <p>It is not in my Power, to adjuſt their Differences; nor is it Material to a <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:102963:60"/>which of them has the <hi>Law</hi> on their Side. Yet, if I were inclin'd to take any Part, it ſhou'd be that of the Oppreſſed. Cruelty I abhor: And our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> has forbid Force to be us'd in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſince the <hi>Conſcience</hi> is Reſponſible to none but <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>May that <hi>God,</hi> from whoſe <hi>

                  <p>I HAD concluded thee Dead, till thy Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certify'd me to the Contrary. So long a Silence between Friends, wou'd put any Man upon the ſame Thoughts. Ten Years have ſlipt away between my laſt to thee, and thy Anſwer. I hope, thou doſt not meaſure <hi>Time,</hi> after the Rate of the <hi>Seven Sleepers.</hi> Perhaps, thou haſt enjoin'd a Ten Years <hi>Silence</hi> and Abſtinence from all Manner of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the <hi>Superiour</hi> of thy <hi>Convent.</hi> Such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities are not uncommon in <hi>Religious Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:102963:60"/>where the main Buſineſs is, to acquire <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> The <hi>Armenian Monaſteries</hi> are much more Rigid, where but for One Extravagant Word, I have known a Man's Tongue lock'd up, for the Space of Two and Twenty Years, under Pain of <hi>Excommunication;</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd, onely for the Sake of a moſt Significant Jeſt, put on the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> in <hi>Mute</hi> Signs. Wit will find a Way to vent it ſelf, tho' it be at the Fingers Ends. And for ought I know, thou haſt oblig'd thy <hi>Abbot</hi> to take off the <hi>Cenſure,</hi> by the like Method. There was Abundance of <hi>Satyre</hi> in the Subſannation of the Ancient <hi>Romans;</hi> and no leſs <hi>Rhetorick</hi> in the Shrugg or Grimace of the Modern <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi> The <hi>Mimicks</hi> of <hi>Scaramouchi,</hi> are a perfect <hi>Lampoon;</hi> and <hi>Harlequin</hi> is <hi>Burleſque</hi> all over.</p>
                  <p>Thou know'ſt; I always entertain thee with one frivolous Diſcourſe or other, to divert thy Melancholy; and thy own Letters give me Encouragement. They ſeem to be writ in a pleaſant Humour. But tell me, have I gueſs'd right at the Cauſe of ſo tedious a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs, or no? Haſt thou been forc'd all this while, to ſpeak with thy Hands, Feet, Noſe, and the Emphatick Motions of thy Head and Eyes? If it were ſo, I phanſie thou wert excellent Company, among thy Grave Flegmatick Brethren; and in a fair Way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Language of the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> who by curvetting, creeping, leaping, frisking their Tails and other Poſtures, expreſs their vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Paſſions, Deſires and Neceſſities, as Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102963:61"/>to thoſe who are us'd to them, as we can do by the moſt Elegant Addreſſes in Words.</p>
                  <p>But, to be ſerious: If for the Sake of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> this <hi>Penance</hi> be impos'd on thee by <hi>him</hi> who Preſides over thy <hi>Convent,</hi> or thou haſt Voluntarily undertaken ſo difficult a Part of Self-Denyal on the Score of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> or <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> thou haſt approv'd thy ſelf wiſe and brave in not flinching. A Coward in <hi>Religious</hi> Matters, is as deſpicable, as in the Engagements of the World. 'Tis Honourable to face Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and come off with Victory.</p>
                  <p>As for what thou deſireſt to know concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sepulcher</hi> of King <hi>Childeric;</hi> It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd a Piece of great <hi>Antiquity:</hi> In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he was the Fourth <hi>Monarch</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> He Reign'd over the <hi>Gauls</hi> or <hi>Franks</hi> in the Year 458. <hi>Severus</hi> being <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Rome, Severinus</hi> and <hi>Dagalaiphus, Conſuls.</hi> Yet in little more than Three Years, he was depos'd and baniſh'd by his <hi>Subjects,</hi> whilſt one <hi>Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> was Crown'd in his Stead. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did this Man pleaſe the People ſo well, but that after ſome Experience of his Oppreſſion, Avarice and other Vices, they expell'd him alſo, and recall'd their <hi>Lawful Sovereign.</hi> For, <hi>Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> had vex'd them with Unreaſonable Taxes, fleecing them of many Millions, which he privately ſent out of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> diſpoſing of this vaſt Treaſure at <hi>Rome,</hi> and among his Friends in other Parts, as a Support againſt Future Contingencies: For, he look'd for ſome Back-Blows of <hi>Fate. Childeric</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102963:61"/>being reſtor'd to his <hi>Crown,</hi> enjoy'd it till his Death; which was in the Year 484. After whom ſucceeded in the <hi>Kingdom, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovaeus</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who was the Firſt <hi>French King</hi> that embrac'd <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Time when <hi>Childeric</hi>'s <hi>Tomb</hi> was firſt diſcover'd, was about Two Years ago, when the <hi>Cathedral</hi> of <hi>Tournay</hi> wanted Reparation. For, as the <hi>Labourers</hi> were digging up the Old <hi>Charnel-Houſe,</hi> they encounter'd a Long Stone; which giving 'em ſome Fatigue, they broke in Pieces, and found under it the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>Skeleton</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> lying at Length, with Abundance of <hi>Greek Medals</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> and ſome other Curioſities of the ſame <hi>Metal,</hi> among which was a <hi>Ring</hi> with this <hi>Motto,</hi>

                  <q>SIGILL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M CHILDERICI REGIS.</q>
                  <p>All theſe <hi>Reliques</hi> were at firſt poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Canons</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> where they were found: Of whom they were begg'd by the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who has them in his Cuſtody. Therefore thoſe who told thee they are in the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi>'s Hands, were miſinform'd themſelves, or deſign'd to abuſe thee. For, this cannot be ſuppos'd, during the preſent Wars between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> When they are more ready on both Sides to plunder one another, than to grant Civilities of this Obliging Nature.</p>
                  <p>I perceive, thou art grown a great <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary;</hi> and therefore in Token of my Eſteem, I have ſent thee a <hi>Cabinet</hi> of ſuch <hi>Old Things,</hi>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:102963:62"/>as I have ſcrap'd together in my Travels, and during my Reſidence in this City.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Agates</hi> which thou wilt find in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt</hi> Drawer, may eaſily be dated by their Figures, which are all after the Faſhion of <hi>Gentile Rome.</hi> As for the <hi>Shells</hi> in the <hi>Second,</hi> I leave 'em to thy own Judgment; onely this I will ſay, That they are not Common. The <hi>Third</hi> contains a Miſcellany of ſeveral <hi>Antiques.</hi> The <hi>Knives</hi> were us'd by the Ancient <hi>Roman Prieſts</hi> in their <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> The <hi>Weights</hi> are at leaſt Twelve Hundred Years Old, by the Parallels which I have ſeen in the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</hi> The <hi>Rings</hi> alſo are of the <hi>Parthian</hi> Make: And the <hi>Arrow</hi> to which they are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd, retains its <hi>Oriental Venom</hi> to this Hour; as thou wilt find by trying it on any <hi>Animal</hi> that deſerves it. But, after all, the <hi>Lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt</hi> Drawer contains Nothing but <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits.</hi> For, thoſe <hi>Medals</hi> are the Work of <hi>Parmezan,</hi> the Fineſt <hi>Graver</hi> in the World. If thou know'ſt not his Character, I'll tell thee in a Word; He was Famous for Imitating ſo Exactly the moſt Ancient <hi>Medals,</hi> that the <hi>Tranſcripts</hi> cou'd not be diſcern'd, even by the moſt Skillful <hi>Artiſts,</hi> from the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Accept theſe, with the ſame good Will as I did, when they were preſented to me, and tell me wherein elſe I can gratify thy Wiſhes.</p>
                  <p>You <hi>Monaſticks</hi> are infinitely Happy, in the Advantages of Retirement and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. You are free from the Cares which moleſt other Mortals. The <hi>Bell</hi> rings you to

                  </head>
                  <p>BY the Sound which the Sun makes at his going down, I ſwear, I was not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the <hi>Idea</hi> I had of thy Generoſity.

                  <p>I ſhall with exquiſite Diligence obey thy Orders. But it cannot be attempted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vaſt Sums of Money. And if I may be thought worthy to give Advice to my <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,</hi> the moſt Effectual Way to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this, will be by ſending one of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Miniſters</hi> to this <hi>Court,</hi> with a ſplendid <hi>Embaſſy.</hi> For, this Young <hi>King</hi> expects very Honourable Addreſſes, from all that ſeek his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102963:63"/>more Intimate Friendſhip. Therefore a <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus</hi> wou'd be ſlighted on ſuch an Occaſion, and marr all the Deſign. I wou'd counſel, That ſome-body be ſent, who perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>French,</hi> and the particular Aims of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under the Protection of ſuch a one, I ſhou'd be able without Hazard of a Diſcovery, to act all that is neceſſary to carry on this Deſign with good Succeſs. Here are Abundance of needy <hi>Courtiers,</hi> on whom Gold will have a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Influence. But neither I in Perſon, nor any one whom I ſhall depute, can make ſuch Tenders, unleſs there were here ſome known Publick <hi>Embaſſador</hi> from the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to countenance the Buſineſs. For, otherwiſe it will preſently be whiſper'd, That ſome <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Agent</hi> lurks here <hi>Incognito.</hi> They will ſtart a Thouſand <hi>Chimaera's</hi> of Jealouſie; and ſo I may run the Hazard of a <hi>Second</hi> Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſhall call to mind the Occaſion of my <hi>Firſt.</hi> All that I can then ſay of my being a <hi>Moldavian,</hi> will find no Credit; and 'twill be no leſs than a Miracle, if they do not expoſe me to a Scrutiny for the Mark of <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> Which if it be found, all's betray'd and ruin'd.</p>
                  <p>I do not value the Puniſhments they will inflict on me, nor the Loſs of my Life: But I dread the more Important Conſequences of ſuch a Diſcovery; the unmasking the <hi>Secrets</hi> of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Chief Reaſons I have to offer in behalf of an Honourable <hi>Embaſſy.</hi> As to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102963:63"/>the Perſon whom thou ſhalt think fit to employ in ſo Glorious a Truſt, I will not preſume to add any Thing to what I have ſaid already, That he be a Man of Experience in the <hi>French</hi> Affairs, well vers'd in the Knowledge of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Policy, the different Intereſts of the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and one that exactly knows what Advantage to make of the New <hi>Pope.</hi> For, after long Debates, the <hi>Cardinals</hi> have at laſt Elected one, who has aſſum'd the Name of <hi>Alexander</hi> VII.</p>
                  <p>It is hard to judge at his Firſt Acceſſion to that <hi>Sovereign Chair,</hi> what Intereſt this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> will embrace, whether that of <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain:</hi> Or whether his Conduct will be <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral,</hi> deporting himſelf with an Equal Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all the <hi>Nazarene Princes,</hi> whom he calls his <hi>Sons,</hi> endeavouring to compoſe their Quarrels, and unite their Forces againſt the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> I tell thee, no body can be yet aſſur'd, what the Temper of the <hi>Roman Mufti</hi> may prove. For, it is uſual for the aſpiring <hi>Cardinals,</hi> to promiſe many Things in Hopes of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> which they never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, when they have once obtain'd that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable</hi> Command. <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> is rank'd among the <hi>Principal</hi> Vertues, in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> And he that knows not how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe his Affections, is not thought worthy of any Important <hi>Truſt. Adonai</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> has loſt his Liberty in that City, for being defective in this Courtly Accompliſhment. It ſeems, he and ſome others of his <hi>Nation</hi> rail'd too paſſionately and openly, at the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the

                  <p>By what I have ſaid, thou wilt perceive, that I conſult thy Happineſs, and wou'd have thee chaſe away Vain Fears and Superſtitious Thoughts, the mere Product of an Ill-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd Spleen, which is the peculiar Malady of thy <hi>Nation.</hi> Let thy Heart be always Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for <hi>God</hi> loves every Thing that he has made: The <hi>

                  <p>I had rather hear from thee Matter of News, than theſe diſmal Scruples about thy <hi>Soul.</hi> If thou art not willing to embrace the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith,</hi> in <hi>God</hi>'s Name continue to obſerve the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and proſecute thy Affairs with Alacrity.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I believe the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and 'tis ſo firmly Imprinted in my Memory, that I cou'd repeat it <hi>Verbatim</hi> from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the End, without miſſing a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicle.</hi> I give an Entire Credence to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> being Naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of <hi>Immortality:</hi> But I cannot entertain the groſs Conceit, which the greateſt Part of <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> have of the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> that is, that our very <hi>Duſt</hi> ſhall be Rais'd again, and Organiz'd into a <hi>Body.</hi> The <hi>Nazarenes</hi> are of the ſame Opinion. But methinks, there's no Need of ſtretching and ſtraining of <hi>Nature.</hi> Beſides, this Opinion is Inconſiſtent with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fundamental Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are all taught to believe, That the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Juſt Men, Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on their Departure from the <hi>Body,</hi> aſcend to <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> If ſo, then they either live there in an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbodyed Eſtate,</hi> or they have <hi>New Bodies</hi> aſſign'd 'em by the ſame <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> which gave them their <hi>Old.</hi> Be it which Way it pleaſes <hi>God;</hi> It will appear a manifeſt Botch in the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> an <hi>Indecorum</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> to make theſe <hi>Souls</hi> either caſt off their <hi>New Bodies</hi> at the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> for the Sake of their <hi>Old Rotten Reliques,</hi> after they have enjoy'd all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102963:66"/>the Raviſhing Delights of <hi>Eden</hi> for ſo many Ages; or to ſtand in Need of any <hi>Bodies</hi> at all, after they have liv'd ſo long in a <hi>Separate</hi> Condition. There's no Sence in't. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, this Opinion was firſt hatch'd by thoſe who believ'd the <hi>Sleep</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> and held that it was Inſeparable from the <hi>Body.</hi> For then they had no other Way to comfort themſelves with any Probable Hopes of a <hi>Surviving Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> but by maintaining, That as the <hi>Soul</hi> ſlept with the <hi>Body</hi> in the <hi>Grave,</hi> ſo both <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> ſhou'd conjointly Riſe again at the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Doom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or perhaps, this <hi>Figure</hi> of our <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was inculcated, to inſinuate the Faith of an <hi>Immortal</hi> State, into the duller Minds of thoſe, who were Incapable of comprehending either the <hi>Pre-Exiſtence</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> their <hi>Self-Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence</hi> after <hi>Death,</hi> or their <hi>Tranſlation</hi> into other <hi>Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me much more eaſie to believe, according to the moſt Obvious <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that after our <hi>Diſſolution</hi> here, we ſhall either aſſume ſome <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Air, Fire,</hi> or other <hi>Elemental</hi> Supplement, or by Magnetick <hi>Tranſmigration</hi> ſhall be United to ſome <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> or <hi>Animal Embryo;</hi> than to dream of Recollecting all our Scatter'd <hi>Aſhes</hi> together, after ſo many Thouſands of Years, wherein they have been diſpers'd, perhaps through all the Ranges of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, our <hi>Holy Lawgiver,</hi> and all the other <hi>Prophets,</hi> intended no other Thing by the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> but only to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102963:67"/>convince the World, that the <hi>Soul</hi> was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and that conſequently there wou'd be a Reward of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> Works after this <hi>Life.</hi> We ſhall live for ever, Old <hi>Lawyer:</hi> And what ſignifies it, whether we have the ſame <hi>Bodies</hi> or others, ſo long as we are Happy in any State: And if we are Metamorphos'd, we cannot fail of our <hi>Specifick</hi> Felicity, ſince every <hi>Creature</hi> is Happy in its Own <hi>Eſſence.</hi> Then let us be <hi>Apes, Dromedaries, Camels,</hi> or any Thing but <hi>Hogs,</hi> and we ſhall have Bliſs enough. That <hi>Creature</hi> is the very <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> and therefore its <hi>Life</hi> cannot be the Object of a <hi>Muſſulman</hi>'s Wiſh. Yet we know not the <hi>Laws</hi> of our <hi>Change,</hi> or <hi>Tranſmigration</hi> from this <hi>Mortal</hi> Life. For the <hi>Soul,</hi> according to <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi> is Capable of all <hi>Forms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou wond'reſt what has put me upon this Diſcourſe, it is the Remembrance of what I have heard thee relate of the <hi>Apparition</hi> of <hi>Dead Mens Bones</hi> in the <hi>Cemetery</hi> of <hi>Grand Caire</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> at a certain Seaſon of the Year, when Multitudes of People by Cuſtom flock thither to behold this Wonderful <hi>Scene</hi> of a <hi>Sham-Reſurrection.</hi> I can give it no better Title, ſince in all Probability, 'tis only the Effect of ſome Artifice us'd by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to procure Money from the Admiring Croud. And I'm confirm'd in this Belief, by a Letter I receiv'd from <hi>Mehemet</hi> the Exil'd <hi>Eunuch,</hi> who now reſides at <hi>Caire;</hi> and having been curious to obſerve this Celebrated <hi>Miracle,</hi> among the other <hi>Rarieties</hi> of this City, ſent

                  <p>THY <hi>Diſpatch</hi> came in a Happy Hour: Yet the Contents of it ſurpriz'd me. 'Tis a ſtrange Turn of <hi>Fortune,</hi> that the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> after ſo many <hi>Rebellions,</hi> ſhou'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Favourite, and be inveſted in the <hi>Higheſt Dignity</hi> of the <hi>Empire.</hi> Yet, who knows, but this may be the onely Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Courſe to reclaim him, and of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to render him a Friend? For, <hi>Ambition</hi> is a <hi>Vice</hi> ſo nearly bordering on <hi>Vertue,</hi> ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd and ſubtle in its Complexion, that when the Paſſion which cheriſhes it, is once grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with its proper Object, it ſoon becomes a <hi>Vertue</hi> it ſelf, and transforms a <hi>Libertine</hi> to a <hi>Hadgi,</hi> ranking a Man to Day among the moſt deſerving <hi>Hero's,</hi> who but Yeſterday was in the Number of the <hi>Seditious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, I cannot but highly applaud the Counſel of thoſe, who perſwaded the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to this Uncommon Choice of the <hi>Vizir Azem.</hi> The whole <hi>Empire</hi> has languiſh'd for Want of a Man of Abilities in that <hi>Supreme Station,</hi> ever ſince the <hi>Seal</hi> was taken from the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Chuſaein Baſſa</hi> through the Malice of his Enemies. And in this Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, they cou'd not have pitch'd on a Man
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102963:68"/>more capable of the <hi>Charge,</hi> than this bold <hi>Baſſa;</hi> who, beſides his Experience in the Wars, both by Sea and Land, is look'd on as the Stouteſt Man in this Age. As for his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Crimes, they proceeded onely from his Diſcontent, and Thirſt of Glory, which is now ſufficiently allay'd by the Bounty of our <hi>Sovereign.</hi> The <hi>Cauſe</hi> therefore of his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances being thus ſeaſonably remov'd, the <hi>Effect</hi> will naturally ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>But, ſuffer me to ask thee; Do they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> his Approaches to that <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of <hi>Mortals,</hi> with ſuch a Formidable Retinue? Thou telleſt me, he is attended by Forty Thouſand Men, an Equipage fit for a <hi>Sovereign Monarch.</hi> Perhaps, 'tis onely the Effect of his <hi>Martial Genius,</hi> and that he is willing to appear like a Soldier. Or, it may be, he really ſuſpected Danger, and that he was deſign'd for a Sacrifice: Which made him come thus guarded to the Feet of his <hi>Maſter:</hi> That his Son might revenge his Death, by ſome deſparate Attempt on <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Be it how it pleaſes <hi>God,</hi> it ſeems, the <hi>Sultan</hi> wink'd at all, and receiv'd him with ſuch Marks of his Eſteem and Affection, as are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom vouchſaf'd to <hi>Subjects.</hi> I hope, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent will anſwer his Expectation. Theſe new Methods of Clemency may prove more ſucceſsful, than the ſevere Conduct of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Times. Men of Great <hi>Souls,</hi> are ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſubdu'd by Favour, than Force and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:102963:69"/>
                  <p>I am extremely oblig'd to thee for thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which I ſhall exactly obſerve, in writing to this <hi>Supreme Miniſter.</hi> Thou haſt match'd my own Thoughts, in this Advice. For, knowing that <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Temper, it will be Policy, as well as Juſtice, frankly to own what I have writ againſt him, and not ſtuff my Letter with abject fawning Submiſſions, or ſneaking Excuſes. He is brave himſelf, and will be pleas'd to ſee a Man reſolute in his Duty.</p>
                  <p>However, let the Conſequence be what it will, I muſt follow the Meaſures of my own Integrity. There is Something ſo Satisfactory in Truth, and an honeſt blunt Carriage, as far ſurpaſſes the little faint Pleaſures of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Diſſimulation. And I ſhou'd be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my <hi>Life,</hi> were I forc'd to preſerve it by ſuch Effeminate Tricks. Yet, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, 'tis a vaſt Encouragement, to find thy Sentiments the ſame. What is this <hi>World,</hi> that we ſhou'd be ſo fond of it? Or what is the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Mortals,</hi> that we need be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudious of prolonging the Reſpiration of that Breath, which may with as much Eaſe be all breath'd out at once, as by ſo many Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Millions of Moments? For, <hi>Death</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly poſſeſſes but an <hi>Inſtant</hi> of <hi>Time;</hi> no more does <hi>Life.</hi> Every Gaſp renews the One, and the Laſt commences and finiſhes the Other. As to Pleaſure and Pain, we generally have an Equal Share of 'em. And it appears to me an Equal, if not a Greater Happineſs, at once to be freed for ever from the Latter, than by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102963:69"/>ſuch an irkſom Compoſition to protract the Enjoyment of the Former.</p>
                  <p>Brave <hi>Solyman,</hi> when I contemplate thy Vertue, it inſpires me with Courage againſt the vain Miſts of Fear, which the <hi>Magick</hi> of Opinion has rais'd before the Eyes of Mortals. I embrace thee with an extended <hi>Soul,</hi> and wiſh thee the Two Extremes of Happineſs, Plenitude of Joys in this Life, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal <hi>Series</hi> of Felicities in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Live for Ever thou Generous Son of <hi>Cham.</hi>

                  <head>To the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> at the <hi>Port.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BY the <hi>Souls</hi> of all my <hi>Progenitors,</hi> I was glad to hear the News of thy Advance to this Glorious <hi>Height</hi> of <hi>Power:</hi> Yet when thou wert <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and heldeſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> I accus'd thee to the <hi>Divan,</hi> doing thereby no ſmall Service to the <hi>Ottoman Empire:</hi> For which thou haſt now Reaſon, in Honour, to reward me; knowing, that I prevented a great Deal of Confuſion and Blood. It will not become the <hi>Firſt Miniſter,</hi> to cheriſh Private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102963:70"/>or harbour Ill Thoughts of a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Slave.</hi> In diſcovering thy Intrigues at that Time, I did but perform my Duty to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> thy <hi>Lord</hi> and mine. Nay, for ought thou know'ſt, I was happily Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in ſaving thy Life, which might have been loſt in the Purſuit of thoſe Hazardous Projects thou wert then engag'd in. Be it how it will, thou art now living, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall'd in the moſt Illuſtrious Charge of the <hi>Empire.</hi> And, without Flattery I ſpeak it, a braver Man cou'd not have aſcended to that <hi>Dignity.</hi> May <hi>God</hi> long continue thee in it, to the Joy and Advantage of all the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the World extoll thy Valour and Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; eſpecially the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> among whom the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo</hi> is Famous. They alſo highly commend thy Juſtice. And thou wilt find in the <hi>Regiſter,</hi> that when I acquainted my <hi>Superiours</hi> of thy <hi>Revolt,</hi> I was not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious in concealing thy <hi>Vertues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore I beg of thee, not to be Partial in thy Reſentments; but conſider <hi>Mahmut</hi> as a Faithful <hi>Slave,</hi> who will never tranſgreſs the Commands of the <hi>Myſterious Bench,</hi> nor ſuffer any Siniſter Motives to byaſs him, tho' 'twere in Favour of his own Brother. For, this is the ſevere Conduct that is expected of me by my <hi>Superiours,</hi> and which thou thy ſelf wilt require at my Hands.</p>
                  <p>But, I believe, thou needeſt not theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to move thee to Generoſity. Thy own Native Juſtice will ſuggeſt to thee, that I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther merit a Reward than a Puniſhment, for
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102963:70"/>doing my Duty, tho' 'twere in accuſing thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Confiding therefore in thy Goodneſs, and my own Innocence, I ſhall not deſpair of that Protection and Favour from thee, which all thy <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> have afforded me, ſince my Arrival at this Place. Nay, I think thy Friendſhip and Eſteem is rather due to me, than to a Thouſand <hi>Sycophants</hi> and <hi>Flatterers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will, in this Confidence, write freely to thee, as I have been commanded; and vent my Thoughts, without a Timorous Reſerve. For, thou art the <hi>Juſt Judge</hi> of the <hi>Judges,</hi> among the <hi>Faithful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no Doubt, but thou haſt heard of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> a Famous Warriour in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts, but now a <hi>Priſoner</hi> of <hi>State</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> I ſent Intelligence laſt Year to <hi>Muſtapha Berber Aga,</hi> of the Grounds and Circumſtances of this <hi>Prince</hi>'s Confinement: Whereof thou can'ſt not be Ignorant. For, all my <hi>Diſpatches</hi> are made Publick to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Port.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Brother of that <hi>Duke</hi> immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, by the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Orders, in the Command of the Army in <hi>Flanders.</hi> They call him <hi>Duke Francis.</hi> Every Body thought that he had conſented to the Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of his Brother, as being diſguſted at his Inconſtancy, Avarice, and other Vices. It was ſuppos'd alſo, that his own Ambition, and Thirſt of Honour, had corrupted the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Love he ow'd to the Son of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as knowing that by his Fall, he himſelf ſhou'd riſe to the Dignity of <hi>General,</hi> which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102963:71"/>his Brother enjoy'd during his Liberty.</p>
                  <p>But now 'tis evident, that this <hi>Duke Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> did all along diſſemble his Reſentments of his Brother's Calamity. For, he is lately Revolted from the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and come over to the <hi>French,</hi> with Five Thouſand Horſe and Foot. He has openly declar'd, That he will never give Reſt to his Sword, till he has either procur'd his Brother's Releaſe, or deeply reveng'd the Injuries have been done him. He was receiv'd by the <hi>French King,</hi> with all imaginable Endearments and Careſſes. The whole <hi>Court</hi> are Emulous, in ſtriving to excell one another in the Demonſtrations of their Civility and Reſpect to this <hi>Prince:</hi> And they have cull'd out the beſt Quarters for his Soldiers. This <hi>Nation</hi> is always Hoſpitable to <hi>Strangers;</hi> more eſpecially to ſuch as court their Friendſhip after this Extraordinary Way, who enter into their Intereſts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in their Quarrels. Yet neither <hi>France,</hi> nor all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> together, can match the Bounty of the <hi>Munificent Port,</hi> which pardons and receives with open Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces her moſt Implacable Enemies, on their Submiſſions, and Repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commander</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulman Grandees,</hi> thou art but a Man, and haſt not exceeded that Character, in the Worſt of thy Errors. Now, thou art aſſum'd to a <hi>Charge</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Fidelity and Prudence of an <hi>Angel.</hi> If thou ſhalt reform the <hi>State,</hi> and reſtore the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Affairs to their true Luſtre, we ſhall have Reaſon to contemplate thy <hi>Life</hi>

                     <hi>To</hi> Mehemet, <hi>an Exil'd</hi> Eunuch, at Caire <hi>in</hi> Egypt.</head>
                  <p>THOU telleſt me Wonderful Things of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſuch as almoſt ſurpaſs Credit. And I perceive thou thy ſelf doſt not believe the Story of the <hi>Annual Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Bones,</hi> which is ſo much talk'd of by <hi>Travellers.</hi> My Couſin <hi>Iſouf</hi> Ridicul'd it with ſmart Reaſon; and was almoſt in Danger of his Life among the Bigotted <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Coptites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I cou'd hardly imagain there had ſtill remain'd in that <hi>Region</hi> (which has undergone ſo many Revolutions of Government) any Foot-ſteps of the Primitive <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Yet it ſeems, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of thoſe <hi>Early Ages</hi> were particularly careful to tranſmit to Poſterity, an Exact <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of their <hi>Kings,</hi> with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs</hi> of their <hi>Actions,</hi> the Building of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids,</hi> the Palace of the <hi>Statues,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Mirrour,</hi> the <hi>City</hi> of the <hi>Black Eagle,</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:102963:72"/>the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Daemons</hi> ſeated on the <hi>Brow</hi> of the <hi>Mountain</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Palace</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant,</hi> with Innumerable other Rareties.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee, my dear <hi>Mehemet,</hi> I know not how to believe all theſe <hi>Romantick</hi> Stories. It cramps my Reaſon to hear of a <hi>Brazen Tree,</hi> with <hi>Iron Branches,</hi> and <hi>Verſatile Hooks,</hi> to catch <hi>Lyers</hi> and <hi>Cheats,</hi> and there detain 'em till they ſhou'd do Right to thoſe whom they had Injur'd. Altogether as Improbable is the Story of <hi>Gabdapharouis,</hi> the <hi>Statue</hi> ſet up by King <hi>Gariac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who can read of that <hi>Monarch</hi>'s being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the Air by <hi>Eagles,</hi> but may as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Romantick</hi> Voyage of <hi>Domingo Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſales</hi> to the <hi>Moon.</hi> If thou know'ſt not that Story, I'll tell thee in ſhort, That this was a certain <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who in a Paſſage to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> being by Shipwreck caſt aſhore on the <hi>Iſland</hi> of St. <hi>Helena,</hi> with a <hi>Negro</hi> his <hi>Slave,</hi> they were put to their Shifts ſo far as to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that Unpeopled and Deſolate <hi>Iſland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em, out of pure Neceſſity, that they might both find Proviſion enough to keep 'em from ſtarving (for it ſeems, there was great Scarcity of every Thing that ſerv'd the Uſes of Life.)</p>
                  <p>In this Condition, <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Cunning Devices,</hi> taught them to hold Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with one another tho' living at Oppoſite Angles of the <hi>Iſle,</hi> by the Help of certain Wild <hi>Swans,</hi> which they took out of their Neſts very Young, and brought 'em up as they do <hi>Pigeons</hi> at <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Aleppo,</hi> to be <hi>Letter-Carriers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:102963:72"/>
                  <p>Afterwards, as the Story goes, <hi>Domingo</hi> trying ſeveral Experiments on his Birds, and finding all Succeſsful, at laſt, having got Four and Twenty of them together, and having brought 'em up to his Lure, he ventur'd his Carcaſe with 'em in the Air, faſtening 'em to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Ropes and other Materials. But the Extravagant Animals one Day took Wing, and carry'd their <hi>Maſter</hi> to the <hi>Moon:</hi> Where he reſided a conſiderable Time, ſaw and convers'd with Divers Inhabitants of that Neighbouring <hi>Globe,</hi> viſited the <hi>Courts</hi> of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Lunar Princes,</hi> and was kindly receiv'd by 'em all, even at the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the <hi>Chief Emperor,</hi> or <hi>Grand Signior</hi> himſelf. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been preſented with Three <hi>Stones</hi> of Matchleſs Virtue, and other Rich Gifts, he had his Audience of <hi>Congè,</hi> and came down to the Earth again, where he publiſh'd a <hi>Journal</hi> of his <hi>Travels,</hi> out of which I have extracted this ſhort <hi>Epitome;</hi> not thinking it worth the while, to trouble thee with the Entire Relation of his Ingenious Whimſies.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, there is Nothing ſo eaſie, as to invent new and unheard of <hi>Fables,</hi> to amuſe the Credulous World, and Captivate their Underſtandings. And I have told thee this, as a Parallel to thoſe Monſtrous Figments of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Such as that of King <hi>Gancam</hi>'s being carry'd in a Pavillion on the Shoulders of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:</hi> His <hi>Magical Tables,</hi> and the reſt of his glorious Whim-Whams. And that of the Queen <hi>Borſa,</hi> who ſate on a <hi>Fiery Throne,</hi> and liv'd in an <hi>Enchanted Caſtle,</hi> whoſe Walls
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102963:73"/>were full of Pipes, which convey'd to her the <hi>Addreſſes</hi> of all Sorts of <hi>Plaintiffs,</hi> and her <hi>Decree</hi> and Deciſion of Controverſies back again to them. Such another is that of <hi>Barde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir</hi>'s <hi>Silver Tower,</hi> and his ſitting before his People in the Clouds of <hi>Heaven:</hi> And <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doura</hi>'s ſending an <hi>Angel,</hi> who made ſuch a Horrible Roaring, that it caus'd an <hi>Earth-Quake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who can without laughing, read the Story of the <hi>Idol</hi> of the <hi>Teſt,</hi> which diſtinguiſh'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Harlots</hi> and <hi>Virgins</hi> by the Touch of their Hand? Or of the <hi>Spirits</hi> which guard the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> One like a Naked Woman, walking about in the Open Air at Noon, and making Men run Mad for Love of her? Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Form of an Old Man with a Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket on his Head, and a Cenſer in his Hand? A Third, of a Black Woman, with a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Child in her Arms? There is no End of ſuch <hi>Fables.</hi> Neither can any Man of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſtoop to ſo much Eaſineſs as to regard 'em.

                  </p>
                  <p>If my Intelligence be true, a more Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Fleet</hi> has not ſail'd out of the <hi>Ottoman Harbours,</hi> than appears now at Sea, under thy Command.

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Venetians</hi> are not like the Reſt of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> Superſtitiouſly devoted to the Sentiments of their <hi>Prieſts.</hi> That Kind of Bigottry, chains up Mens Spirits, and renders 'em Effeminate: It blinds 'em, and robs 'em of their Senſe and Native Vigour. But theſe are bold, reſolute People, fearing neither <hi>Man</hi> nor the <hi>Devil.</hi> They are alſo well vers'd in Stratagems, being as Cunning as <hi>Serpents.</hi> In fine, <hi>Venice</hi> is a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> made up of Soldiers and Stateſmen: And thou canſt not expect, that the Sea makes 'em degenerate.

                  <p>OUR Kinſman <hi>Iſouf</hi> is now gone for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovy,</hi> having viſited the moſt Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Places in this <hi>Kingdom.</hi> I receiv'd a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from him dated at <hi>Diep,</hi> a Sea-Town over againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts. He was juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboard, as he tells me, when he deliver'd his <hi>Diſpatch</hi> to the <hi>Poſt. God</hi> grant him à Proſperous Voyage to that <hi>Region,</hi> and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever his <hi>Genius</hi> or Fortune carry him.</p>
                  <p>I am extremely pleas'd with his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whilſt he was in <hi>Paris,</hi> I was never ſenſible of Melancholy, unleſs 'twere in the Evenings, which forc'd us to part Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He has an Excellent Memory, and recounts all the Adventures of his Life with a great deal of Eaſe, both to himſelf and his Hearers: He never was at a Loſs for Matter, or confounded one Circumſtance with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but ranking every Thing in its due Time and Place, deliver'd all with a Clearneſs and Grace, which affected me with ſingular Delight.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, he has a ready Wit, lively Fancy, and Judgment enough for one of his Years. I tell thee, the Relations he has made of his <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,</hi> with his Regular Deportment here in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102963:76"/>
                     <hi>Paris,</hi> of which I have been a Witneſs, have Imprinted in me ſuch an Opinion of his Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, that I have truſted him with ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Inſtructions, in order to a ſettl'd Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between us, in whatſoever <hi>Court</hi> he reſides. For, in a Word, I find him Mature enough for Buſineſs of Moment: And 'tis Pity his Parts ſhou'd be bury'd without ever appearing in Action.</p>
                  <p>If he ſucceeds in what I have put him upon, when he arrives at <hi>Archangel,</hi> a <hi>Sea-Port</hi> of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and a Place of great Commerce and Traffick; I ſhall have good Reaſon to hope for more Important Matters, when he comes to <hi>Moſco,</hi> the Chief City of the Men who worſhip the Eyes of their <hi>Emperour.</hi> And then it will be Time to give a due Character of him to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port:</hi> Wherein thou wilt have many Opportunities, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Office of a Kinſman and Friend. Thoſe of the ſame <hi>Blood,</hi> ought thus to ſerve one another with Integrity and Affection: For, in ſo doing, we help our ſelves, ſtrengthen the Intereſt of our <hi>Family,</hi> and ſhall find Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in Time of Need. As thou haſt receiv'd Favour from <hi>Kerker Haſſan, Baſſa,</hi> on the Score of being his Countryman; ſo there is greater Reaſon, that thou ſhould'ſt ſhew Kindneſs to <hi>Iſouf,</hi> who partakes of our <hi>Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There ariſes a vaſt Complacency from doing Good Offices, tho' to a Stranger, or even to an Enemy. Man is Naturally Generous; and he has debauch'd his <hi>Soul,</hi> who acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this Principle. Yet the greateſt Part
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102963:77"/>of Men are degenerated. They purſue <hi>Lyons, Tygers, Bears,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Ravenous</hi> Beaſts, with Inexorable Hatred and Revenge; they bear ſecret <hi>Antipathies</hi> againſt <hi>Spiders, Toads, Serpents,</hi> and other <hi>Venomous</hi> Creatures; and yet they are all theſe Things, or worſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Ever ſince <hi>Aſtraea</hi> abandon'd the <hi>Earth,</hi> there has been a ſtrange <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis</hi> in our <hi>Race:</hi> Men have for the moſt Part forſaken their Humanity, and chang'd Nature with the <hi>Salvages.</hi> Nay, we tranſcend them in whatſoever is Cruel and Vicious. As if our <hi>Reaſon</hi> were given us, onely to teach us the moſt Refin'd Methods of Impiety, and to be a more exquiſite Spur to Vice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſouf</hi> has preſented me with Solid Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Kind in his <hi>Travels,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Africk.</hi> He ſay, that <hi>Region</hi> is not more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifick of Strange and Horrible <hi>Beaſts,</hi> than it is of <hi>Monſtrous Men, Brutes</hi> and <hi>Devils</hi> in <hi>Humane Shape.</hi> And tho' he relates ſome Fair Things of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and other People in <hi>Aſia;</hi> yet they are intermix'd with <hi>Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Reports, and Mournful <hi>Memoirs:</hi> Such as ſtain the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of our <hi>Race,</hi> and make it evident, That it is hard to meet with one Good Man among Ten Thouſand. The whole World is over-run with Oppreſſion, Cruelty, Avarice, Perfidy, and Luſt.</p>
                  <p>He relates ſtrange Things of the <hi>Antiquities</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> He calls it the onely <hi>Scene</hi> of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Miracles on Earth. Indeed this <hi>Country</hi> was ever Famous among all <hi>Nations</hi> for the Wiſdom and Learning of her <hi>Prieſts;</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:102963:77"/>who, in the <hi>Firſt Ages</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all the <hi>Secrets</hi> of the <hi>Elements,</hi> the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Minerals,</hi> and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly vers'd in the <hi>Science</hi> of the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> and in all Manner of <hi>Myſterious</hi> Knowledge. They were ſaid to make <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> that cou'd Speak, Walk, Run, and counterfeit all Human Actions. They were alſo exquiſite in making Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Taliſmans</hi> and <hi>Mirrours,</hi> with any kind of <hi>Magical</hi> Work, whereby they kept the <hi>People,</hi> and even the <hi>Princes</hi> in a Profound Awe and Veneration of their Prodigious Knowledge and Power, and likewiſe defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their <hi>Country</hi> againſt all <hi>Invaders.</hi> For no ſooner did an Enemy appear with his Armies on the <hi>Frontiers</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> had preſent Intimation of it by their <hi>Secret Art,</hi> even in their Chambers, perhaps at a Hundred Leagues Diſtance. Then by their <hi>Enchantments,</hi> they either caus'd Fire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them in their Camps, or turned their Swords againſt each other, or ſent an Army of <hi>Winged Serpents</hi> to deſtroy 'em. So that for many <hi>Ages,</hi> no <hi>King</hi> ever proſpered that fought againſt the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let not thou and I, dear Brother, ſuffer our Reaſon to degenerate, by giving Credit to Fictions and Romances, though vouch'd by ſome of our Countrymen, ſuch as <hi>Morat Alzeman, Eb'n Abdalhokm,</hi> and others.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102963:80"/>to this <hi>Tradition</hi> ſhall be extended o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the <hi>Regions</hi> of the Earth for the Space of Nine <hi>Moons.</hi> After which Term, <hi>God</hi> ſhall ſend the Firſt <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> who ſhall gather the diſpers'd <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and conduct them to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> From whence he ſhall iſſue forth, with a Victorious Army, and lay waſte the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> ſack <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and carry away the Immenſe Riches of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> And the very Fear of him ſhall reduce all <hi>Nations</hi> to his Obedience. He ſhall fight with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millai Haraſcha,</hi> the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> and ſhall deſtroy Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of <hi>Armillai</hi>'s Followers; but in the End ſhall be ſlain himſelf, and the Good <hi>Angels</hi> ſhall tranſport his Body to the <hi>Apartment</hi> of the <hi>Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> hold, That this <hi>Armillai</hi> ſhall ſpring out of an <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> made of <hi>Marble,</hi> with which the moſt Wicked and Profligate among Men ſhall be enamour'd, and commit the moſt execrable Uncleanneſs that can be nam'd. The Reſult of theſe <hi>Adulterous</hi> Congreſſes ſhall be, That the <hi>Statue</hi> by a <hi>Supernatural Power,</hi> ſhall prove <hi>Impregnate,</hi> and cleaving aſunder ſhall be deliver'd of this Young <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who is to vex and perſecute the <hi>Jews,</hi> and afflict them with greater Calamities than either <hi>they</hi> or their <hi>Fathers</hi> felt ſince the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> They ſhall be forc'd to flee into the <hi>Deſarts,</hi> and hide themſelves in the Dens and Caves of the Earth, living onely on the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102963:81"/>Graſs, and Herbage, with the Leaves of Trees; till the great <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel</hi> ſhall Thrice wind his <hi>Horn.</hi> Then ſhall the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> with <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> appear, who ſhall reſcue 'em out of all their Troubles, and lead them Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant to <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Sum of what <hi>Nathan,</hi> and all the <hi>Jews</hi> believe concerning the <hi>Laſt Times,</hi> which they ſay are now approaching: As is evident by the Riſing of this <hi>New Star,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with terrible Thunders and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. And the <hi>Chief Patriarch</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> is come from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to prepare thoſe of his <hi>Nation</hi> in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts, for the <hi>Grand Revolutions</hi> which they believe are ready to fall out in the <hi>World.</hi> All the <hi>Jews</hi> in that City went out a League to meet him, with great Pomp and Solemnity.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while I hear that the Son of the late <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> makes a Confuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Parts adjacent, being at the Head of Fifty Thouſand Men, on Pretence to revenge the Death of his Father.

And without calling to Remembrance the <hi>Trojan Wars,</hi> the Unhappy Effects of <hi>Helena</hi>'s Perfidy, we may conclude, That Women are the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many Quarrels among us.</p>

He went away at the Beginning of the <hi>Treaty,</hi> and has wandred up and down <hi>Germany</hi> ever ſince; ſometimes keeping a <hi>Court</hi> like a <hi>King,</hi> at other Times living <hi>Incognito,</hi> and very pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, with onely Two or Three Attendants. That poor <hi>Prince</hi> is very Unfortunate; yet, they ſay, he bears his Calamity with ſingular Moderation, and a certain <hi>Royal</hi> Stiffneſs of Mind, which will rather break than bend.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Pope</hi> is a great <hi>Peace-Maker,</hi> and has ſent <hi>Nuntio's</hi> with Letters to all the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> within the <hi>Pale</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> earneſtly perſwading them to Unity and Friendſhip, that ſo their Arms may be turn'd againſt the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> His <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor</hi> was of another Sentiment, and wou'd not inter-meddle in the Quarrels of any. One Day, as he was looking out of a Window of his <hi>Palace</hi> with ſome <hi>Cardinals,</hi> they ſpied Two Men a fighting in the Street; whereupon, they deſired the <hi>Holy Father</hi> to interpoſe his Authority, and command Peace. But he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, ſaying, <hi>Let them fight it out, and then they'll be good Friends of Courſe.</hi> And turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Spaniſh Embaſſador,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>So will it fare with your Maſter, and the King of</hi> France: <hi>When they have ſufficiently wearied out one another with Wars, they will gladly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Propoſals of Peace.</hi>

                  <p>Formerly, thou wert troubl'd with dull Melancholy Thoughts about <hi>Religion:</hi> Now thou art angry with thy <hi>Trade,</hi> and pineſt that thou wert not Educated in the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> A <hi>Mechanick</hi> Life, thou ſay'ſt, is Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and Irkſome: Beſides, that it is beneath one of thy <hi>Blood,</hi> to be always employ'd in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102963:82"/>making of <hi>Turbants.</hi> Thou wiſheſt rather to have been a <hi>Courtier, Soldier,</hi> or any Thing ſave what thou art.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Couſin,</hi> let not Pride and Ambition corrupt thy Manners. Doſt thou not conſider, that all <hi>True Believers</hi> are oblig'd to exerciſe ſome <hi>Manual</hi> Occupation, and that the <hi>Sultan</hi> himſelf is not exempted from this Duty? Did not the <hi>Prophet</hi> himſelf practiſe it, and enjoin it to all his <hi>Followers?</hi> Haſt thou not heard of his Words, when he ſaid; <hi>No Man can eat any Thing ſweeter in this World, than what is acquir'd by his own Labour?</hi> Doubtleſs, all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Holy Men,</hi> have gain'd their Bread by their Lawful Employments. <hi>Adam</hi> was a <hi>Gardiner, Abel</hi> a <hi>Shepherd, Seth</hi> a <hi>Weaver, Enoch</hi> a <hi>Taylor, Noah</hi> a <hi>Ship-wright: Moſes, Saguib,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> were <hi>Shepherds: Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> a <hi>Carpenter: Abu-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, Omar, Othman, Gali,</hi> and <hi>Gabdoracha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> were <hi>Merchants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doſt thou eſteem thy ſelf of better <hi>Blood</hi> than <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom thou receiv'dſt thine? For Shame prefer not thy ſelf to <hi>Noah,</hi> the <hi>Reſtorer</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> to <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> to <hi>Mahomet</hi> our <hi>Holy Lawgiver,</hi> and to the Reſt of thoſe Excellent Perſons, who thought it no Contempt to work at their ſeveral <hi>Trades,</hi> and eat the Bread of their own Labours.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, doſt thou conſider the dangerous Intrigues of a <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Court.</hi> Art thou ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently arm'd with Wit and Dexterity, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thy <hi>Station</hi> againſt the Wily Trains of deſigning Men? I do not reproach thy Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102963:83"/>Yet I think thou wilt do better in the <hi>Poſt</hi> allotted thee by <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> that is, in thy Proper <hi>Calling;</hi> than in the perillous Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe who ſtand or fall at the Pleaſure of Others. Whereas, thou art now thy own Man, and needeſt fear no Tempeſts of <hi>State,</hi> or Frowns of thy <hi>Prince,</hi> ſo long as thou pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueſt none but thy private Affairs. Many So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign <hi>Monarchs</hi> have envy'd ſuch as thee, when they have ſeen, how chearfully and quietly they paſs'd away their Time, under the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrella</hi> of an Obſcure and Private Life: Whereas, at the <hi>Court,</hi> there is Nothing but Intriguing, Plotting, and Treachery; one Undermining another, to make Way for their own Advance. The <hi>Court</hi> is a perfect <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre,</hi> of Fraud, Diſſimulation, Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and a Thouſand <hi>Vices,</hi> which there act their various Parts, under the Habit and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of ſeeming <hi>Vertues.</hi> There a Man muſt flatter the <hi>Great,</hi> and ſpeak againſt his own Sence, and the Truth, to procure the Favour of ſome dignify'd Fool: Than which, Nothing is more Ignoble and Baſe.</p>
                  <p>This puts me in Mind of a pleaſant <hi>Repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,</hi> which <hi>Diogenes</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> gave to a <hi>Courtier.</hi> The <hi>Spark</hi> paſſing by <hi>Diogenes,</hi> as he ſat in a <hi>Tub,</hi> Eating of <hi>Turneps,</hi> put this Scoff upon him; <hi>Diogenes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>If thou wou'dſt but learn the Art of Flattery, thou need'ſt not ſit here in a Tub, ſcranching of Roots.</hi> To whom the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> reply'd: <hi>And thou, vain-glorious Man, if thou wou'd'ſt but learn to live contented with my homely Fare, need'ſt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102963:83"/>not condeſcend to the Fawning of a Spaniel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Couſin,</hi> let not this Paſſage cauſe thee to emulate the <hi>Philoſopher</hi>'s Manner of Life; For, he had his <hi>Vices,</hi> as well as other Men. If he was no Flatterer, yet he was Proud and Opinionative: He laid Trains for the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of Men in all his Actions, and ſo taught others to become Flatterers, tho' he was none himſelf. All his pretended Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Mortification, and Rigour, were but ſo many Decoys for Fame. Of this, <hi>Plato</hi> was ſenſible, who was a far more Excellent <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher</hi> than he. As this <hi>Sage</hi> was one Day walking with ſome of his Friends in the Fields, they ſhew'd him <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſtanding up to the Chin in Water, whoſe <hi>Superficies</hi> was frozen over, ſave one Hole that <hi>Diogenes</hi> had made for himſelf. <hi>Puh,</hi> ſays <hi>Plato, don't regard him, and he'll ſoon be out: For, had he not ſeen us coming this Way, he wou'd not have put himſelf to this Pain.</hi> Another Time this <hi>Philoſopher</hi> came to <hi>Plato</hi>'s Houſe: And as he walk'd on the Rich <hi>Carpets</hi> with which the Floor of the <hi>Hall</hi> was cover'd; <hi>See,</hi> ſaid <hi>Diogenes, how I trample on</hi> Plato<hi>'s Pride. Yes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Plato, but with greater Pride.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, the greateſt <hi>Philoſophers, Doctors,</hi> and even <hi>Saints</hi> themſelves have their Errors and Failings. Do not therefore affect to change thy <hi>Calling,</hi> for the Life of a <hi>Student</hi> or a Contemplative Man. For, the ſame Diſcontent will ſtill haunt thee in that State, which makes thee ſo uneaſy now. Thou art a perfect Stranger to the Intolerable Anguiſh
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102963:84"/>of Mind which afflicts <hi>Thinking</hi> Men, and ſuch as apply themſelves to the Study of the <hi>Sciences.</hi> They labour under a Perpetual Thirſt of Knowledge; and the more they learn, the greater and more Ardent is their Deſire of farther Diſcoveries. So that the moſt accompliſh'd <hi>Sages,</hi> are no more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with their own Acquiſitions, than he who has never meddl'd with <hi>Books.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then, as to their Bodies, they are always vex'd with one Malady or other, proceeding from the violent Agitation of their Spirits, the Intenſeneſs of their Thoughts, perpetual poring upon <hi>Books,</hi> and their Sedentary Life.</p>
                  <p>In all that I have ſaid, I do not diſſwade thee from ſeeking after Knowledge. I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther counſel thee to read <hi>Books,</hi> and I gave thee the ſame Advice in a former Letter. But, do it with Moderation. Let not thy Studies entrench on the Affairs of thy <hi>Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Read <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> or other <hi>Tracts</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy Fancy, when thou haſt nothing elſe to do. But, do not follow it ſo cloſe, as if thou aſpired'ſt to the Character of a Compleat <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> or <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> Still remember, that thou art a <hi>Turbant-Maker,</hi> and that by the <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Fate</hi> thou art born for this Buſineſs. Follow it with Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and Mirth. When thou art at thy Work, 'twill be pleaſant meditating on what thou haſt read at thy ſpare Hours. Thou wilt find thy ſelf much more happy, in thus mixing Studies with the neceſſary Offices of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102963:84"/>thy <hi>Trade,</hi> than in abandoning thy ſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a Contemplative Life. And in the Midſt of thy Diſguſts, thou mayſt comfort thy ſelf with this Reflection, That thou art of none of the moſt Deſpicable <hi>Callings,</hi> which ſerve the Neceſſities of Man's Body. Had thy Employment been onely to make <hi>Papouches</hi> or <hi>Sandals,</hi> which cover the Feet, it might have been an Argument of Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to thee, in Regard the Foot is the moſt Contemptible Member in the Body. But now thou paſſeſt thy Time in making Ornaments for the Head, which is the Nobleſt Part, and Commnader of all the Reſt, thou haſt no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to repine.</p>
                  <p>If, after all, thou reſolveſt to change thy Courſe of Life, I adviſe thee to turn <hi>Soldier;</hi> for, then thou muſt be contented and patient <hi>per</hi>-force.</p>

                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:102963:85"/>For, when they pray to her, it is the Cuſtom to number their <hi>Oraiſons</hi> on <hi>Beads.</hi> But all this while they conſider not, that he may be a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> as to their <hi>Religion,</hi> and inſtead of addreſſing his <hi>Prayers</hi> to her, may direct them to <hi>God</hi> alone; as all the <hi>True Faithful</hi> do, who uſe <hi>Beads,</hi> in rehearſing the <hi>Divine Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as well as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in repeating their <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> which they ſay, was the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation</hi> that <hi>Gabriel</hi> gave the <hi>Virgin,</hi> when he enter'd her <hi>Oratory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Be it how it will, he gets Abundance of Money by his <hi>Devotion:</hi> For the <hi>Franks</hi> are really very Charitable, and give plentiful <hi>Alms</hi> to the <hi>Poor.</hi> But eſpecially to one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Circumſtances, they are extremely Liberal, that ſo they may imprint in him a more fervent Affection, and profound Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for their <hi>Religion.</hi>

This <hi>Prince</hi> is now at <hi>Valentia,</hi> under the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Juriſdiction, who allows him a Conſiderable <hi>Penſion,</hi> and has given him Leave to marry a <hi>Princeſs</hi> of that <hi>Country,</hi> very Beautiful and Ingenious, but of a Poor Fortune. He has one Son by her; and 'tis ſaid, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> deſigns to ſet forth a Mighty <hi>Fleet</hi> of <hi>Ships:</hi> And having furniſh'd this <hi>Prince</hi> with all Things neceſſary for a Warlike Expedition, will ſend him thus Equipp'd to claim the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Tunis;</hi> or in Caſe of Denial, to make a <hi>Deſcent</hi> in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and fight for it. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, this will onely prove a <hi>Spaniſh Rhodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montade;</hi> that <hi>Monarch</hi> having Work enough cut out for him in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to divert him from any ſuch Wild Enterprize on <hi>Africk.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, this <hi>Don Philippo</hi> is much talk'd of in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Hopes of Conquering a Great Part of <hi>Barbary</hi> by his Means, he having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Friends and a conſiderable Intereſt in thoſe <hi>Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou mayſt acquaint the <hi>Divan,</hi> that <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> the <hi>Dwarf</hi> is ſtill living, and ſerves the <hi>Port</hi> with a ſecret and untainted Zeal. Two days ago he diſcover'd a Cunning Practice of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> whoſe Motions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues he watches very narrowly. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures me, That this <hi>Miniſter</hi> has diſpatch'd
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102963:86"/>away Two <hi>Agents</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> with a Letter to each of theſe <hi>Princes</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> alſo with Blank Papers, and the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Seal,</hi> giving them Inſtructions, to fill up thoſe <hi>Blanks</hi> and Seal them with the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Signet,</hi> according as they found the <hi>Treaty</hi> go forward between thoſe <hi>Princes.</hi> The main Deſign of this Trick being, to hinder them from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a <hi>League</hi> againſt the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> by all the Artifice theſe <hi>Agents</hi> cou'd uſe, in exactly timeing and ſuiting their Counterfeit Letters, to the Difficulties and Miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that always happen in ſuch <hi>Treaties,</hi> that ſo they may exaſperate each <hi>Party</hi> againſt the other, as Occaſion offer'd, without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſend to <hi>France</hi> for freſh Letters, which wou'd breed too much Delay, and ſpoil their Deſign.</p>
                  <p>By this thou mayſt perceive, that <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> comes not ſhort of his Predeceſſor <hi>Richlieu,</hi> in managing the Affairs of <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Courts.</hi> He is the very <hi>Soul</hi> of all the Grand Buſineſs in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A general Heart-burning has poſſeſs'd the <hi>French,</hi> eſpecially the Inhabitants of <hi>Paris,</hi> ever ſince the Concluſion of the laſt Year, when the <hi>King</hi> iſſu'd out certain <hi>Orders,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that all the Gold and Silver-Money in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſhou'd be brought in to his <hi>Mint</hi> to be new Coin'd. The <hi>Merchants</hi> firſt complain'd of this <hi>Edict;</hi> and then it was murmur'd at by all Trading People. At Length the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> took it into
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102963:87"/>their Conſideration, and oppos'd the <hi>King</hi>'s Pleaſure: Upon which he baniſh'd Eight of their <hi>Members,</hi> and has ſeveral Times prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited them to Aſſemble; yet they perſiſted to meet, till he baniſh'd more of them: Which inſtead of awing them into the expected Compliance, has but incens'd 'em more: And the diſcontented <hi>Clergy</hi> blow up the Coals, as do likewiſe the Friends of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde.</hi> The <hi>Parliament</hi> are very bold and peremptory in their Proceedings, having expreſsly forbid the Citizens of <hi>Paris</hi> to obey the <hi>King</hi>'s Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and decreed that Nothing ſhall be done in their <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> till the Baniſh'd <hi>Senators</hi> be recall'd.</p>
                  <p>Things being at this Paſs, we expect No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Inſurrections, Maſſacres and other Effects of Popular Fury. The Rich are lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in vaſt Quantities of Corn and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, as if they expected a Siege. And the Poor fare the better for it, whilſt great Largeſſes are given among them by the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees</hi> of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to engage them in the <hi>Faction.</hi> Beſides, thou know'ſt, the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude always delights in Novelty and State-Tempeſts, hoping for Plunder, and to enrich themſelves by the Ruine of others.</p>
                  <p>I know not what Conduct is fitteſt for me to uſe in this Caſe. Whether it will be beſt for me to abide in this City, or follow the <hi>Court,</hi> which is now at <hi>La Fere</hi> in <hi>Picardy.</hi> Or Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhould retire to ſome other Place, leſs liable to Civil Diſturbances.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102963:87"/>what I ought to do in theſe Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Rome</hi> we hear, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals</hi> are in great Conſternation on ſome Intelligence they have receiv'd, That the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> intend to make a <hi>Deſcent</hi> on the <hi>Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> That <hi>Nation</hi> is now become the <hi>Great Bug-bear</hi> of all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſince they have molded themſelves into a <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>

                  <p>Every <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi> has a Time to riſe, and another to fall. But, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Period wherein the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will decline, which is not yet advanc'd to its <hi>Zenith?</hi>

                     <hi>To</hi> Sedrec Al' Giraw'n, <hi>Chief Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer to the</hi> Grand Signior.</head>
                  <p>THY Vertues have at Length rais'd thee to a Glorious <hi>Truſt,</hi> the Charge of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Wealth. Thou haſt in thy Cuſtody, the Riches which cannot be match'd in the Univerſe. <hi>God</hi> inſpire thee with Graces ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a <hi>Dignity</hi> ſo full of Temptations. I hope, thou wilt not be affronted at my Prayer,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102963:88"/>as was thy Predeceſſor <hi>Kienan Baſſa,</hi> at ſome Counſels of like Nature, which I gave him in a Letter. Some Men are ſtrangely Cholerick, and look on him as an Enemy who gives them good Advice. I onely warn'd him of the ordinary Cheats that are practis'd at Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Times in the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> which thou know'ſt to be true, as well as I. And I tell thee far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he himſelf was ſuſpected by many in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> not to have been altogether exempt from Guilt.</p>
                  <p>Whether he were or not, I perform'd but my Duty in giving him neceſſary Cautions. For, ſuch is the Will of my <hi>Superiours,</hi> that I ſhou'd not be afraid to unravel the Secrets of thoſe who are falſe to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> I did not charge him with ſuch a Crime, and therefore he had no Reaſon to be angry: But ſome Men will pick a Quarrel with their own Shadows. In a Word, this <hi>Grandee</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got himſelf.</p>
                  <p>In ſaying ſo, I do not reflect on his <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> or that he was found ſleeping on a Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> a poor ragged Infant, when the <hi>Tartars</hi> took him Captive, among many Thouſands of others, in the Plunder of <hi>Tſinarow,</hi> and ſold him to the <hi>Capa Agaſi,</hi> for Thirteen <hi>Piaſters,</hi> by Reaſon of his Beauty. I do not call to mind the Circumſtances of his Youth; ſince 'tis common for the meaneſt Slaves, to arrive at an Extraordinary Grandeur by their Merits, or at leaſt through the Favour of the <hi>Sultan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:102963:88"/>
                  <p>But what I aim at is, that in his being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at the Remonſtrances I made of ſome private and ſiniſter Practices in the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> he forgot, that he himſelf is ſtill a <hi>Slave</hi> to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> as well as I, and therefore not above Inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Well, it ſeems he is now made <hi>Captain Baſſa,</hi> and thou ſucceedeſt him in the Office of <hi>Treaſurer.</hi> To <hi>him</hi> I wiſh all Imaginable Succeſs and Victories at Sea, for the Sake of our <hi>Great Maſter,</hi> and the <hi>Muſſulman Empire:</hi> To <hi>thee,</hi> for thy own Sake, and for my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, whom I know thou wilt ever reſpect as a Friend; I wiſh Encreaſe of Riches and Honours, even as thy Merits and Services aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Eſteem of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and of all the World.</p>
                  <p>And, I tell thee, I have far livelier Hopes to ſee this Latter Wiſh take Effect, than the Former: For, what Reaſon have we to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect better Luck from the Courage or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this <hi>Ouroos Kienan,</hi> than from the brave <hi>Zorneſan Muſtapha,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Fleet</hi> laſt Year?</p>
                  <p>This Unhappy Thought has put me into as melancholy a Humour, as <hi>Aeneas</hi> was in when the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> required an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Trojan Wars.</hi> For, I have heard that <hi>Cara Muſtapha, Baſſa,</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Zor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſan</hi> in the Command of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and in the Revolution of a <hi>Moon</hi> was made <hi>Manſoul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for the Sake of <hi>Kienan Baſſa,</hi> or rather for the Sake of the licentious Souldiers, who it ſeems command all Things. I have been inform'd
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102963:89"/>alſo, of all the other <hi>Tragedies</hi> Acted at the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> ſince the Second <hi>Moon</hi> of this Year. Neither are the Cauſes and Origin of ſo much Slaughter and Blood-ſhed hid from me. 'Tis too apparent, that there is an Univerſal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and Corruption in the Diſcipline of the <hi>Janizaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I formerly wrote to the <hi>Kiaya Bey</hi> on this Account. But it ſeems, Avarice the Root of all Evil, had render'd him Inſenſible and Obdurate.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a Shame that the Pay of thoſe who ſerve the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in the Wars, ſhou'd be detain'd, not Three or Four <hi>Moons,</hi> but Five or Six <hi>Years,</hi> by their corrupt <hi>Officers?</hi> They ſit at home enjoying their Eaſe, revelling in Taverns, and committing a Thouſand Riots; whilſt the others undergo numberleſs Fatigues abroad, and are reduc'd to the extremeſt Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, not having ſo much as the Veſts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd 'em by the <hi>Sultan,</hi> to cover their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs! And, if they complain of their Sufferings, inſtead of Redreſs they meet with Nothing but Taunts and Reproaches, as if they were not worthy to eat the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Bread and Salt, tho' they freely hazard their Lives for him. It is no Wonder, the <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> are ſo unbridl'd in their Rage, after ſo many Provocations.</p>
                  <p>Yet, I cannot but lament the Fate of thoſe Unfortunate Men, who were ſacrific'd to the Fury of that inſolent <hi>Militia:</hi> Eſpecially, I condole the Loſs of the brave <hi>Solyman Kyzlir Aga.</hi> The <hi>Janizaries</hi> had on old Grudge
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102963:89"/>againſt him, ever ſince his hot Diſpute with the <hi>Boſtangi Baſſa,</hi> and now they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to execute their Revenge.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Kiaya Bey,</hi> it ſeems to be a Stroak of <hi>Divine</hi> Juſtice, that he who had been the Cauſe of all this Mutiny, ſhou'd in Remorſe ſtrangle Himſelf, and ſo go to <hi>Hell,</hi> as an Expiation for the many Lives he had caſt away.</p>
                  <p>And there's little leſs to be ſaid, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Mufti,</hi> who was the Chief of thoſe that betray'd their Maſter, <hi>Sultan Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him.</hi> To tell thee my true Reſentments, I am heartily ſorry for all the Reſt: But to thoſe who were concern'd in that <hi>Treaſon,</hi> there ſeems no Pity due. And the <hi>Mufti</hi> may thank <hi>God</hi> and his good Stars, that his Life went not with the Others. They report here, he is fled into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, what was that <hi>Gelep Aſſan,</hi> who head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Rabble of Mutineers? I have heard Nothing of him, before the Intelligence I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd of his ſudden Riſe, and equally preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate Fall, during this Tumult. He was, I ſuppoſe, ſome paſſionate Fool, of an ill-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd Midriff, which us'd to make a Quarrel between his Heart and his Spleen: And from this Inteſtine Broil, he habitually learn'd the Way to ſet People together by the Ears. A popular Man, an Incendiary, and one that knew how to wheadle the Vulgar to his own Ruine. Who can give an Account of theſe Things? Or who can unravel the Web of Deſtiny? Tho' there's nothing ſtrange in his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102963:90"/>particular Caſe, yet in the General 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, That ſuch little Inſtruments ſhou'd be able to give ſo terrible a Shock to the Frame of an Ancient and Mighty Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
                  <p>He was a Man of no Fame or Character, and yet for the Space of Two <hi>Moons,</hi> he may be ſaid to command the Greateſt <hi>Sovereign</hi> in the World, Sole Proprietor of Fame and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And, had he puſh'd on his Intereſt, 'tis not improbable, but that he might have exalted himſelf above his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd his Poſt againſt all After-claps. For, according to my Intelligence, he had during the Sedition, heap'd together prodigious Sums of Money, the Preſents of <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and other <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> who all ador'd this new riſing <hi>Comet,</hi> and ſought his Protection and Favour againſt the Barbarous Rabble. But, it ſeems, he was infatuated with too much Glory, and conſider'd not that every Body watch'd all Opportunities and Occaſions to ruine him: And that his very Followers, wou'd be the Firſt to betray him, as ſoon as the Hurry of their <hi>Inſurrection</hi> was over. This generally happens to all <hi>Ringleaders</hi> of <hi>Parties.</hi> When once the <hi>Spirits</hi> of a <hi>Faction</hi> are ſpent, the <hi>Lees</hi> (which conſiſt of Regret and Confuſion) are diſcharg'd on thoſe who firſt fermented them, mix'd with the Revenge of the <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are Abundance of Great and brave Men gone: But, the old <hi>Negidher</hi> was of their Council, and he brought them to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102963:90"/>Ruine, as he did the <hi>Coreis</hi> of <hi>Mecca,</hi> when they conſpir'd againſt the Life of the <hi>Prophet.</hi> This <hi>Devil</hi> enter'd the <hi>Temple</hi> (where they were aſſembled) in the Shape of an Ancient Man, decrepid and leaning on a Crutch. And when he was commanded to withdraw, he told them, <hi>He was a Senior, who had ſeen all Ages, and remark'd the Occurrences of Times; that he was expert in unfolding Secrets, and rendring Difficult Things eaſie.</hi> In a Word, he us'd ſo many plauſible Inſinuations, that they admitted him into their Aſſembly. But, none of their Counſels proſper'd.</p>
                  <p>That malicious <hi>Daemon,</hi> is often preſent in the Cabals of Seditious Men; and tho' they ſee him not, yet he ſecretly undermines their Plots, and brings 'em to Shame and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, he is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Envy:</hi> And tho' he be himſelf a Rebel, and the <hi>Ringleader</hi> of a <hi>Faction</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Air;</hi> yet, ſuch is his ſpightful nature, that he ſeldom ſuffers any <hi>Rebellion</hi> to thrive on Earth: Not for any Love that he bears to <hi>Government,</hi> but becauſe he delights to be active in Miſchief, be it where it will; and the <hi>Guardian Spirits,</hi> will not ſuffer him to mix with the eſtabliſh'd <hi>Divans</hi> of an <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The All-Good <hi>God</hi> preſerve thee from the Malice of Wicked <hi>Daemons,</hi> who always hover about <hi>Treaſures</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver.</hi>

                  <p>THE Troubles of the <hi>Sublime Port</hi> touch'd me ſo nearly, and embark'd my Soul in ſuch a Tempeſt of ſollicitous Thoughts and Anxieties, for the Honour and Safety of the <hi>Oſman Empire,</hi> that I had no Leiſure to think of my own particular Hazards, whilſt I was writing the other Letter. Yet I have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulph'd in Abundance of Vexatious Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and perillous Accidents.</p>
                  <p>It generally happens, that when one Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune befalls a Man, it brings a Train along with it. So that at ſome Seaſons we ſeem to be beſieged with Evils, or at leaſt ſo cloſely block'd up by an Army of Calamities, that there is no Paſſage left open, either for Relief or Intelligence.</p>
                  <p>So has it far'd with me of late, and with Thouſands of others, I doubt not, in this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous City. The <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> is the Occaſion of all this. For, the <hi>King</hi> having ſome Reaſons to apprehend a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Conſpiracy of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Friends and Well-Wiſhers in <hi>Paris</hi> and other Places, has caus'd a very ſevere Scrutiny to be made of all Strangers and Sojourners. The <hi>Soubaſhi's</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi> go to every Houſe within their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct,</hi> taking down the Names of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in Writing, and ſeizing the Perſons
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102963:91"/>of thoſe whom they ſuſpect. The Priſons are fill'd with People of all Ranks, and the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> are ſent to the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of the <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciennes.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, the <hi>King</hi> has a Liſt of many Thouſands of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Party in <hi>Paris,</hi> who deſign'd on a prefix'd Day to take up Arms for that <hi>Prince,</hi> and that their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wou'd have been follow'd all over the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> knows what is in the Hearts of theſe <hi>Infidels:</hi> I am ſure, <hi>Mahmut</hi> is wholly a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to their <hi>Plots.</hi> Tho' laſt Year I receiv'd certain Inſtructions from the <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> commanding me to act ſecretly in the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Behalf, to abett the <hi>Faction,</hi> and uſe all the Endeavours and Art I could, to raiſe a New <hi>Party</hi> for him among the <hi>Courtiers.</hi> But, I wav'd ſo dangerous an Employment, by propoſing to him the vaſt Expences it wou'd require, and the Neceſſity of ſending ſome Extraordinary <hi>Embaſſy</hi> to this <hi>Court,</hi> to countenance the Buſineſs. To tell thee the Truth, I eſteem'd it a Thing Impracticable, and a mere <hi>Caprice</hi> of that Active <hi>Baſſa,</hi> who had a Natural Kindneſs for <hi>Rebels,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to have a Hand in difficult Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, whether there was any Likelyhood of Succeſs or not.</p>
                  <p>But, he is dead, and let that atone for all his <hi>Rebellions,</hi> when he had the Command of <hi>Aleppo.</hi> I love not to load the departed <hi>Souls</hi> with Accuſations. What I have to ſay, is in my own Vindication, who cou'd not approve his <hi>Politick Chimaera:</hi> In Regard, had it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102963:92"/>no Profit or Advantage wou'd from thence ariſe to the <hi>Ottoman Empire:</hi> And had it been diſcover'd, not only I and all the <hi>Secrets</hi> of my <hi>Commiſſion</hi> wou'd have lain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the <hi>Infidels,</hi> but alſo it wou'd have been an Eternal Diſhonour and Blemiſh to the High Reſplendent <hi>Port,</hi> to be found guilty of violating in ſo notorious a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Faith it had given to the moſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> and <hi>Puiſſant Monarchy</hi> among the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarenes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, I knew not but this <hi>Miniſter</hi> had a private Grudge againſt me, for accuſing him formerly to the <hi>Divan,</hi> when he held Correſpondence with the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and that he ſtudy'd this Way to be reveng'd, by em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying me in an Affair, which muſt needs be my Ruine. However, I think I had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be Cautious, and Apprehenſive of the Worſt. This made me diſpatch to him a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, full of ſpecious Umbrages, ſeeming to approve his Deſign, but entangling it with ſuch Difficulties, as wou'd divert him from farther Thoughts of it.</p>
                  <p>Yet after all, I have been really brought into Danger, on the bare Suſpicion of being concern'd on the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Side: By which thou may'ſt gueſs at the Conſequence, had I hearken'd to the <hi>Vizir</hi>'s Advice.</p>
                  <p>One Morning early, the <hi>Officers</hi> appointed for this Purpoſe enter'd my Chamber: And having demanded my Name, Buſineſs and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; I anſwer'd, <hi>My Name was</hi> Titus Durlach Nieski; <hi>but that for Shortneſs, and to denote
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102963:92"/>my Country, I was commonly call'd</hi> Titus <hi>the</hi> Moldavian; <hi>and that by this Name I was well known to</hi> Cardinal Mazarini, <hi>as I had been to his Predeceſſor</hi> Richlieu, <hi>and other Courtiers of great Quality.</hi> I told 'em likewiſe, <hi>That I was a Clerk, who underſtood ſome Foreign Languages, and therefore had been often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by thoſe</hi> Cardinals, <hi>in tranſlating Books out of</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Arabick <hi>into</hi> Latin <hi>and</hi> French: <hi>For which Reaſon, being recommended by</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Richlieu, <hi>I had been introduc'd into the Acquaintance of ſeveral Nobles, whoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren I taught thoſe Languages. And that ſome of them had promis'd to make me Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of St.</hi> Stephen<hi>'s Church, as ſoon as it was Vacant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſeem'd to be very well ſatisfy'd with what I ſaid; but told me moreover, <hi>They had a Commiſſion to ſearch my Lodgings for Arms and Treaſonable Papers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the Horror I was in when I ſaw them go roundly to work, pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into every Corner, and ſearching my Trunks, Coffers and even my Bed it ſelf. Not that I had any Guilt upon me, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing either Arms or Papers relating to this <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> but my Concern was for my <hi>Box</hi> of <hi>Letters</hi> to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port.</hi> As for Arms, they found no other but an old Sword, which I told them I travell'd with out of my own Country, and a Brace of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols for the ſame Uſe, to defend me from Robbers, Aſſaſſins and other Injuries.</p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:102963:93"/>
                  <p>Theſe Fellows ſeem'd mightily pleas'd with the Curious Workmanſhip of my Weapons, ſurvey'd them all over, and having drawn my Sword out of the Scabbard, and made a Paſs or two with it againſt the Wall, after the <hi>French</hi> Mode of Fencing, they put it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; telling me, <hi>They had no Authority to take theſe Arms from me, ſince they were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for my Defence.</hi> But when they came to my <hi>Box</hi> of <hi>Letters,</hi> and ſaw them written in ſtrange Characters which none of them could read; they began to look on one another, and change their Countenances, as if there were ſome dangerous Matter contain'd in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and therefore writ in Cyphers.</p>
                  <p>They went aſide to one End of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whiſpering together, and nodding their Heads with all the Symptoms of Jealouſie. At length, I Interrupting them, ſaid, <q>You need not, Gentlemen, be concern'd about thoſe Papers. They were left with me by a Merchant-<hi>Jew</hi> of my Acquaintance, and they are Letters of Correſpondence between him and ſome of his Brethren at <hi>Rome, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, Amſterdam,</hi> and other Places in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> 'Tis therefore they are written in a Character which to you appears ſtrange, it being <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the <hi>National</hi> Language of the <hi>Jews.</hi> They contain onely Matters of Traffick, being Letters of Mart and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change: For you know, the <hi>Jews</hi> are the greateſt Merchants, Brokers, and Banquiers in the World.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:102963:93"/>
                  <p>Theſe Words, with ſome Gold which I gave them, diſpers'd all their Suſpicions, clear'd up their cloudy Brows, and turn'd their Frowns into Smiles and Complimental Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes. They told me, <hi>I was a very honeſt Man, and they wou'd do me what Service they cou'd.</hi> So bid me adieu.</p>
                  <p>By this thou may'ſt ſee the mighty Power of that Charming Metal, which commands all Things. For, whatever I cou'd have ſaid without that, had been Inſignificant. But theſe <hi>Idolaters,</hi> melted into an Indifference at the Firſt Sight of the glittering <hi>Piſtoles,</hi> and when I had once render'd them thus ductile, 'twas eaſie to frame 'em to the moſt devout Appearance of Reſpect and Friendſhip. They promis'd and ſwore, no Hurt ſhou'd be done me.</p>
                  <p>But I knew the Fickleneſs of human Fidelity better, than to repoſe any great Confidence in theſe Men's Words. As ſoon as they were gone, I convey'd my Letters to <hi>Eliachim,</hi> who cou'd eaſily conceal 'em in any private Corner of his Houſe: deſiring him to furniſh me with ſome Letters of Indifferent Concerns written in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that if theſe <hi>Searchers</hi> ſhou'd come again, and demand a ſecond View of my <hi>Box,</hi> perhaps with Deſign to carry it to ſome <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> I might have thoſe <hi>Hebrew Diſpatches</hi> ready to ſhew; which being put in the ſame <hi>Box,</hi> wou'd not be known from the other by ſuch Ignorant Fellows, to whom <hi>Hebrew, Arabick</hi> and <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> were all alike, and ſo I ſhou'd be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102963:94"/>from all future Trouble of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>And the Event anſwer'd my Expectation. For, within Three Days, the ſame Men came again with others in their Company, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending they had freſh <hi>Warrants,</hi> and were ſworn to be Impartial. Wherefore I was forc'd to attend 'em, whilſt they carry'd both me and my <hi>Box</hi> before a <hi>Cadi</hi> or <hi>Judge,</hi> who having examin'd me very ſtrictly concerning my Name, Country, Religion, and other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſeeming well ſatisfied with all my Anſwers, at laſt ſent for a <hi>Prieſt</hi> well vers'd in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, ordering him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the <hi>Letters:</hi> Which when he had done, he aſſur'd the <hi>Cadi,</hi> that there was not a Word in any of them relating to the <hi>State,</hi> being purely Matters of Private Contracts and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains between Merchant-Correſpondents, with Bills of Lading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So I had my <hi>Box</hi> of Sham-<hi>Letters</hi> reſtor'd to me again, and was honourably diſmiſs'd.</p>
                  <p>Yet, tho' this Storm was ſoon blown over, I was very near running on Rocks and Sands through the Perſecution of thy Predeceſſor <hi>Kienan Baſſa,</hi> and <hi>Kiſur Dramelec,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others in the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> The Firſt keeping from me the <hi>Penſion</hi> allow'd by the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> the Second either ſending me no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, or elſe baffling me with trifling News, nothing to the Purpoſe; the Reſt aſperſing me to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſire thee to ſend me the <hi>Arrears</hi> that are behind for the Space of Nineteen <hi>Moons,</hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe.</hi> Were I a <hi>Diſciple</hi> of that <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> every Morning when I beheld the Riſing <hi>Sun,</hi> and at Mid-Day when I ſaw him Climb the <hi>Meridian,</hi> and in the Evening when he takes his <hi>Congè</hi> of this Upper World to viſit our <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes,</hi> wou'd I with Profoundeſt Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cry out, <hi>O Eternal Chance? O Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Caſualty? O Incomprehenſible Blindneſs! I adore thee, I burn Incenſe to thee, and do all Things which the duller Sort of Mortals think are only due to an All-Wiſe, All-Good, and an All-Mighty God.</hi> Thus wou'd I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to that Infinite <hi>Pell-Mell</hi> of <hi>Atomes,</hi> cou'd I believe with <hi>Epicurus,</hi> that from ſuch an Unconceivable <hi>Hurly-Burly,</hi> proceeded all this Admirable Beauty and Order which we behold.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt perceive by this, that I am Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly diſpos'd; and rather than not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore ſome <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> I wou'd make a <hi>Deity</hi> of that which to others is the Fountain of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> And I think there is Reaſon on my Side. For let this <hi>World</hi> be produc'd how it will, whether by the Caſual <hi>Concourſe</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,</hi> or by the Deliberate Act of an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind;</hi> Whether it be <hi>Eternally Self-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent,</hi> according to the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> or be the Genuine Reſult of the <hi>Divine Idea's,</hi> as the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> ſay; It is but Juſt, that we ſhou'd pay the moſt Devout and Grateful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102963:96"/>to the <hi>Source</hi> of ſo many <hi>Immenſe Prodigies</hi> and <hi>Wonders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then, what ſhall we ſay for all the <hi>EVIL</hi> that appears in the <hi>World?</hi> That there is ſuch a Thing as <hi>EVIL,</hi> ſcatter'd up and down through all the <hi>Ranks</hi> of <hi>Beings,</hi> and as it were blended and rivetted in their very <hi>Eſſences;</hi> is manifeſt at Firſt View, and every Man has his Share of this <hi>Epidemical</hi> Contagion. But whence it proceeds, who can inform me? I am not the Firſt that ask the Queſtion. Many Ages ago the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive World was buſie in ſearching out the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>EVIL.</hi> And there were almoſt as many O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions about it, as there were <hi>Nations</hi> on Earth.</p>
                  <p>Some aſſerted, That all <hi>EVIL</hi> came out of the <hi>North:</hi> Others derive it from the <hi>South;</hi> as if the Two <hi>Poles</hi> were the <hi>Centers</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive-Seats</hi> of this <hi>Malady</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> But theſe ſeem to be Men of Short Diſcourſe and Shallow Reaſon, Supinely Credulous, and willing to take up with any Thing, rather than be at the Pains of Attentive Contemplation.</p>
                  <p>Yet this Opinion has ſo far prevail'd in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts, that the <hi>Nazarene Prieſts</hi> when they Celebrate their <hi>Maſs,</hi> ſtand on the <hi>North</hi> Side of the <hi>Altar</hi> at the Reading the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> turning their Backs to that <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> And the Reaſon they give for this <hi>Ceremony</hi> is, becauſe in the <hi>Written Law</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Out of the</hi> North <hi>comes all EVIL.</hi> I have heard 'em ſeriouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Argument. But, <hi>God</hi> knows whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſuch Place in the <hi>Written
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102963:97"/>Law,</hi> or no: Or, if there be, whether it muſt be taken in this Sence. Yet I muſt confeſs, the <hi>Romans</hi> have ſome Reaſon to believe it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Experimentally felt a great deal of <hi>EVIL</hi> from the <hi>Northern Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi> who in <hi>Former Ages</hi> ruſh'd out of their Frozen <hi>Regions,</hi> and came down like a <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> upon <hi>Italy</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> making Havock of all Things <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.</hi> And, if this be the Ground of their <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> they have greater Reaſon now to change their <hi>Station,</hi> and turn their Backs to the <hi>South-Eaſt,</hi> having been much more Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally handled by the Victorious <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Perſians</hi> held, That there were <hi>Two Principles</hi> or <hi>Sources</hi> of <hi>All Things, viz. GOOD</hi> and <hi>EVIL;</hi> and that there has been an Eternal Quarrel between them: But in the End, they ſay, the <hi>GOOD</hi> ſhall get the Victory, and Exterminate the <hi>EVIL.</hi> This Opinion was embrac'd by a <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> whom they call'd <hi>Manichees.</hi> The Founder of that <hi>Sect,</hi> was a <hi>Perſian</hi> by Birth: His Name was <hi>Manes,</hi> a very Learned Man, as the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> teſtify: Yet the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> rank him among the moſt Pernicious <hi>Hereticks.</hi> He taught, <hi>That Wine was the Blood of Devils;</hi> And therefore forbad it to his <hi>Followers.</hi> He alſo prohibited the Fleſh of <hi>Animals.</hi> This he learn'd from the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he reſided a conſiderable Time.</p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:102963:97"/>
                  <p>But to return to the Sentiments of Men concerning the <hi>Origin</hi> of <hi>EVIL.</hi> There are ſome who affirm, <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Author</hi> of it: Which is not far from <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> Others ſay, That when the <hi>Devils</hi> were Extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the Earth, they in Revenge ſow'd the <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>EVIL</hi> in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi> But that of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> ſeems the moſt plauſible to me: For they aſſerted, That Nothing is <hi>EVIL</hi> of it ſelf, but that the <hi>Contrariety</hi> which we behold in the <hi>World,</hi> is very <hi>Good,</hi> and conduces to Eſtabliſh the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> of <hi>All Things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My dear <hi>Gnet,</hi> do not eſteem me an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt,</hi> becauſe of the Liberty I take in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of theſe <hi>Myſterious</hi> Things. There are a Sort of People here in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> whom they call <hi>Deiſts,</hi> that is, Men profeſſing the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of a <hi>God, Creator</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> but <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> in all Things elſe. They have no <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Faith</hi> in <hi>Hiſtorical Religion,</hi> but think it the Part of Men as they are endu'd with Reaſon, to call in Queſtion the <hi>Writings</hi> of Mortals like themſelves, though they had the Character of the Greateſt <hi>Prophets.</hi> Thus they think it no Sin to canvaſs the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew Prophets,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> of <hi>Mahomet</hi> our <hi>Holy Lawgiver:</hi> Chuſing what is Agreeable to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and rejecting the Reſt as <hi>Fabulous,</hi> inſerted either by the Craft of Men, or the Interloping of the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I proteſt, there appears to me no Reaſon to call theſe Men <hi>Atheiſts</hi> or <hi>Infidels.</hi> They
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102963:98"/>rather ſeem to deſerve the Title of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> or Lovers of Wiſdom and Truth. And 'tis from them I have learn'd this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to be impos'd on in Matters of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> I find them in all Things Men of great Morality and Goodneſs, far exceeding the <hi>Zealots</hi> of the Age in true Virtue and Pious Actions. But they make no Noiſe of what they do: And whilſt only their Human Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are Conſpicuous to all, their Perfections lie conceal'd under the Veil of an Unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd Modeſty.</p>
                  <p>Such of Old were the <hi>Aſſociates</hi> of <hi>Zeid Eb'n Raphaa,</hi> my Country-man.

                  <p>THE <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſay, 'tis an Argument of <hi>God</hi>'s Love when he chaſtiſes them. Therefore they have no Reaſon to be peeviſh, or call it an Effect of his Anger, that a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>Plague</hi> is broke out in the <hi>Territories</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> This Contagion rages ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Capital</hi> City of the <hi>Weſtern Nazarenes,</hi> that above a Hundred Thouſand Perſons of ſeveral Ranks have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken that Place. The <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Palace</hi> is ſhut up, and no Acceſs granted to any, not even to Foreign <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> without great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution; and then, none of their Retinue are admitted with them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, Seventeen Hundred die daily in that City, and Six Thouſand a Day in <hi>Naples.</hi> Nay, in ſome Places, the <hi>Living</hi> are ſcarce ſufficient to bury the <hi>Dead.</hi> The <hi>Grand Duke</hi> of <hi>Toſcany,</hi> to prevent the ſpreading the <hi>Infection</hi> in his <hi>Territories,</hi> has forbid all Intercourſe between his <hi>Subjects</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Pope,</hi> neither will he permit ſo much as a <hi>Nuncio</hi> to paſs through his Dominions.</p>
                  <p>This Mortality has frighted <hi>Queen Chriſtina</hi> from <hi>Rome.</hi> She has ſent to deſire <hi>Paſſes</hi> of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102963:99"/>the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> and other <hi>Princes,</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>France.</hi> She is already on her Voyage, having been preſented by the <hi>Pope</hi> with Ten Thouſand Crowns, to defray the Expences of her Travels. Here are great Preparations making for her Reception: The <hi>King</hi> having ſent Orders to all <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> through which ſhe muſt paſs, to receive and entertain her with a Magnificence due to her <hi>Sovereign Dignity,</hi> and worthy of the <hi>French</hi> Grandeur and Hoſpitality.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, this <hi>Court</hi> is in a ſullen Humour, by Reaſon of a late great Loſs they have ſuffer'd at <hi>Valenciennes</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi> This Place was beſieg'd by the <hi>French,</hi> at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Campagne, but was reliev'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> this <hi>Moon,</hi> who kill'd above a Thouſand Men on the Spot, took Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Priſoners, with all their Cannon and Baggage. Amongſt the Captives of Note, is the <hi>Mareſchal de Ferte Seneterre, General</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Army. The Names of the others are wanting. <hi>Mareſchal de Turenne</hi> himſelf very narrowly eſcap'd, by timely withdrawing his <hi>Brigade</hi> from the Fight: For which ſome ſtigmatize him with Cowardiſe and Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Whilſt others affirm, he acted the Part of a Prudent <hi>Captain,</hi> in thus Retreating, ſince it was impoſſible to reſtore the Battle with any ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Sueden</hi> we hear, that the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> has enter'd into a <hi>League</hi> with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sueden,</hi> by which both their <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> are United againſt the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland:</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:102963:100"/>and 'tis ſaid, their firſt Deſign will be upon <hi>Dantzick.</hi> That Country is in a horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, the <hi>Nobles, Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Boores</hi> being all in Arms, ſome deſerting their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> others adhering to his Intereſt. <hi>King Caſimir,</hi> has inveſted <hi>Warſaw</hi> with an Army of Forty Thouſand Men. In the mean Time, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have ſent a great <hi>Fleet</hi> of <hi>Ships</hi> of <hi>War</hi> into the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea; but to what end, is not known; nor what Part they will take, whether the <hi>Suedes</hi> or <hi>Poles.</hi> Yet, the Latter hope for great Aſſiſtance from them, there having been lately ſome Miſunderſtanding between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>Suedes.</hi> The <hi>Moſcovites</hi> alſo have enter'd <hi>Poland</hi> with a Numerous Army, and the <hi>Tartars</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with another to the Aid of <hi>King Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimir.</hi>

                  <p>HERE has been a ſtrange Accident late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not many Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> which has occaſion'd Various Diſcourſes, and put the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> upon a New Scrutiny. One Morning a certain <hi>Peaſant</hi> or <hi>Farmer,</hi> walking over his Lands, as his Cuſtom is, to number his Sheep and other Cattle, miſs'd a <hi>Barn</hi> or <hi>Store-Houſe</hi> which ſtood in a Field at ſome Diſtance from his Habitation. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at this, he haſten'd towards the Place where he ſaw it but the Night before: When, to his no ſmall Aſtoniſhment, he perceiv'd, that not only the <hi>Barn,</hi> but a great Part of the Field wherein it was built, was ſunk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth. He immediately ran and call'd ſome of his next Neighbours to behold this Strange Spectacle: And the Fame of it ſpread all over the Country. Divers Learned and Ingenious Perſons have been there, to make Obſervations of this Accident. But none dares venture near enough to the <hi>Chaſme,</hi> to look down into it; becauſe the Earth continues breaking and falling in, which makes a Noiſe like the <hi>Salvo</hi>'s of the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> when the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> viſits the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenal.</hi>

                  <p>I Will ſtill Congratulate thy Happineſs, even in this Laſt Change of thy Fortune; which, though it be a Kind of <hi>Deſcent</hi> from the more Lofty <hi>Stations</hi> thou haſt poſſeſs'd in the <hi>Oſman Empire,</hi> yet 'tis attended with Honourable Circumſtances and an Inviolable Security.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102963:102"/>Days in Uncontroulable Eaſe and Felicity.</p>
                  <p>I am not ſurpriz'd at the Fall of ſo many <hi>Great Men</hi> at the <hi>Port,</hi> nor do I much regret the Death of thoſe who were known Enemies to the <hi>Government:</hi> Yet it troubles me to think, how the Brave and the Loyal had their Innocent Blood mingled with that of Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Villains. But, theſe Things are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable in Popular Inſurrections, when the <hi>Sovereign</hi> is compell'd to ſacrifice to the <hi>Multitude,</hi> whomſoever they require. Thus fell the Illuſtrious <hi>Solyman,</hi> among the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> though he himſelf was free from Stain. But he was a <hi>Negro,</hi> and that was his Ruine. For, the <hi>Malecontents</hi> cou'd not diſcern the <hi>Fair Qualities</hi> of his <hi>Soul.</hi>

                  <p>Curſe on that Fool <hi>Chaban Kalfa,</hi> and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Curſes on his Rampant Wife <hi>Mulkly Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> who gave the Firſt Occaſions to all this Diſorder and Spoil of <hi>Noble Blood.</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the honeſt <hi>Solyman</hi> gave me once a Hint of the Feminine Debaucheries practis'd in the <hi>Queen-Mother</hi>'s Apartments: But he ſpoke of it with ſo much Modeſty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it hardly made any Impreſſion on me at that Time. Otherwiſe I ſhou'd have imparted it to the <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Divan;</hi> for, ſo am I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, in Caſes that touch the Honour and Safety of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> And, I tell thee, this was none of the leaſt Importance. For, as it appears, the Women were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the moſt Sacred and Firmly Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd <hi>Government</hi> in the World. They were
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102963:102"/>not contented to wallow in their own Impious and Unnatural Delights, but wou'd have ſet themſelves as a Pattern to others, and by Degrees have infected the whole <hi>Moſelman Empire</hi> with a New <hi>Species</hi> of Debauchery: Which as it began and was carried on by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezilling the Royal Treaſures, ſelling of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Men of no Merit, Buffoons, Pimps and Aſſes; ſo wou'd it have ended in enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our <hi>Militia,</hi> corrupting all the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and laying the <hi>Empire</hi> naked to <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How many <hi>Vizirs, Caimachams, Captain-Baſſa's</hi> and other <hi>Officers</hi> have we had this Fatal Year? Among the Reſt, I cannot but reflect on the Poyſoning of the <hi>Chiaux Baſſa,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was made <hi>Vizir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Azem,</hi> as a Stroke of <hi>Divine</hi> Juſtice, for having embru'd his Hands in ſo much <hi>Noble Blood,</hi> when he enjoy'd that <hi>Dignity</hi> once before. <hi>God</hi> purſues the Cruel with Inviſible Scourges.</p>
                  <p>But what was that <hi>Achmet Baſſa,</hi> who took Advantage of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Domeſtick Troubles, and Foreign Wars, to diſturb his <hi>Government</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and raiſe a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> which threaten'd even the <hi>Imperial</hi> City it ſelf? By the Courſe of his Fortune, it looks as if he were not contented with his <hi>Command</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and therefore took this new celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Method to obtain a Higher <hi>Dignity,</hi> viz. by Rebelling againſt his <hi>Maſter:</hi> Elſe why was he made <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> in the Room of <hi>Ouroos Kienan?</hi> The <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo</hi> firſt brought into Faſhion this daring Way of growing Great. And if it be thus counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanc'd
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102963:103"/>by the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> in all Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he will have Reaſon to make <hi>Peace</hi> with the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that he may have Reſpite, and Forces to employ againſt his own <hi>Subjects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A midſt all theſe Things, Nothing afflicts me ſo much, as the Horrible Loſs our <hi>Fleet</hi> has ſuſtain'd at <hi>Sea.</hi> We have various Reports of this Combat, but in general they agree, That the <hi>Moſelmans</hi> have loſt Seventy Two Ships, and Galleys, with an Infinite Number of Men; That the <hi>Venetians</hi> have taken the <hi>Iſles</hi> of <hi>Tenedos</hi> and <hi>Lemnos,</hi> and that they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing to beſiege <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> This News is a great while coming to us: So that, if it be true, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> purſu'd their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for ought I know, by this Time, the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial</hi> City, the Refuge of the <hi>World,</hi> may be laid in <hi>Aſhes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have often propos'd the Neceſſity of Platforms along the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> to guard that Important Avenue of the <hi>Sacred Port.</hi> Had they put in Practice <hi>Mahmut</hi>'s Advice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> wou'd have had no Occaſion for their preſent Triumphs. But, now they Banquet in the open Streets; All <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> rings with the News of our Diſgrace. The <hi>Drunkards</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> inſult o'er the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of <hi>Sobriety:</hi> Amidſt their Bowls of Wine, they blaſpheme our <hi>Prophet,</hi> and ſing in the Praiſe of <hi>Bacchus</hi> their <hi>God:</hi> They menace the Conqueſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and threaten to exterminate the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmans</hi> from the Earth.</p>

                  <p>If thou woud'ſt know the Occaſion of <hi>Queen Chriſtina</hi>'s being at the <hi>French Court:</hi> She came thither from <hi>Rome,</hi> when the laſt <hi>Moon</hi> was in its <hi>Wane.</hi> Her Paſſage was by Sea to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> having touch'd at <hi>Genoua,</hi> and receiv'd magnificent Gifts from the <hi>Republick;</hi> but they would not permit her to land, for Fear of the <hi>Plague,</hi> which then rag'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> and was the Cauſe of her leaving that City.</p>
                  <p>However, the <hi>French</hi> ſhew'd no ſuch ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Squeamiſhneſs, but receiv'd <hi>Her</hi> and her <hi>Train</hi> with open Arms. She landed at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> on the 29th. of the 7th. <hi>Moon;</hi> and when ſhe made her Publick Entry, the <hi>Conſuls</hi> of that City, with all the <hi>Nobles</hi> met her in Coaches, the Great Guns were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd to welcome her, and ſhe was careſs'd with all the Demonſtrations of Honor that are ſhew'd to the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>France</hi> her ſelf in her Progreſſes.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Entertainment ſhe receiv'd at <hi>Aix, Avignon, Lyons,</hi> and in Fine all along the Road to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Keys of Towns being ſurrendred to her (for ſuch was the <hi>King</hi>'s Pleaſure) and a <hi>Canopy</hi> of <hi>State</hi> born over her Head, when ſhe enter'd any Town, and receiv'd the Addreſſes and Compliments of <hi>Governours, Prelates,</hi> and other <hi>Great Men</hi> in Authority. She was likewiſe Magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated by <hi>Princes</hi> and the Chief <hi>Dukes</hi> of the <hi>Realm:</hi> And on the 8th. of the laſt <hi>Moon,</hi> made her Entry into this City on Horſe-back, apparell'd like a Man: Where having ſtaid ſome Time, ſhe departed for <hi>Compiegne,</hi> to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102963:105"/>viſit the <hi>Court,</hi> which reſides there now.</p>
                  <p>It is not Suppos'd, ſhe will tarry long in <hi>France,</hi> but as ſoon as ſhe hears the <hi>Plague</hi> is abated in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Adjacent Parts, ſhe will return thither, to paſs away the Reſidue of her Life, in that <hi>Neſt</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> of the <hi>Nazarene Belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A little before ſhe left <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> there had Conſpir'd to ſeize on her Perſon, as alſo on the <hi>Pope;</hi> to have Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the <hi>Portugal Embaſſador,</hi> and ſet the City on Fire. But the <hi>Plot</hi> was diſcover'd, and the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> put in Priſon: (For, the <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> is never paſs'd in <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Caſes among the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> without a Formal Tryal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</p>
                  <p>Here is a Rumour, as if a Great Fire had ſome <hi>Moons</hi> ago broke out in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and conſum'd much of that City. I wonder, none of my Friends, nor any other reſiding there, have ſent me an Account of any ſuch Thing. Which fills me with Hopes, that this Report is falſe.</p>
                  <p>From all Hands we are aſſur'd, that the <hi>Suedes</hi> and <hi>Brandenburghers</hi> have obtain'd a great Victory over the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> at <hi>Warſaw;</hi> the Vanquiſh'd having loſt above Six Thouſand Men on the Spot, with all their Ammunition and Baggage: And unfortunate <hi>King Caſimir,</hi> was forc'd to fly with a ſmall Retinue towards <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twas the General Expectation of <hi>Europe,</hi> that the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> wou'd have done ſomething extraordinary for the <hi>Poles,</hi>
                     <pb n="185" facs="tcp:102963:105"/>and by ſome ſurprizing Action, put a check to the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Succeſſes and Triumphs. For, when the <hi>Moſcovite Embaſſador</hi> was at <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningsberg,</hi> endeavouring to withdraw the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> from the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Intereſt, he vomited forth terrible Menaces, in Caſe they comply'd not with His <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals. And one Day, in a furious Zeal, he took a large Goblet of Wine, in the <hi>Elector</hi>'s Preſence; and having drank it off to the <hi>Czars</hi> Health, the <hi>Barbarian</hi> ſaid aloud, <hi>Thus ſhall the great Emperour of the Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites devour all that oppoſe him.</hi> But now it ſeems, theſe were only Empty Bravadoes, and the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> were reſolv'd to ſtand by; and ſee who got the better on't. The ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi> ſo of the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who now all declare for the Srrongeſt Party.</p>
                  <p>Magnanimous <hi>Vizir,</hi> if the preſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements and Wars in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Candy,</hi> beſides the Domeſtick Troubles of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire,</hi> did not wholly employ the Arms of the <hi>Moſelmans;</hi> doubtleſs, 'twould be an Undertaking no leſs Profitable than Glorious, to ſuccour the diſtreſs'd <hi>Caſimir,</hi> turn the Tide of the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Conqueſts, and oblige the <hi>Poles</hi> to an Eternal Fidelity and Gratitude to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>

                  <p>I Have frequent Acceſs to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Library:</hi> Which Favour was firſt granted me by <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> who often employ'd me in Tranſlating ſome Curious <hi>Treatiſes</hi> out of <hi>Arabick</hi> into <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> ſeem very fond of <hi>Eaſtern Manuſcripts,</hi> where ever they can meet with 'em: And they have no leſs Regard for Men who are skill'd in thoſe <hi>Languages.</hi> That <hi>Miniſter</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, was very Inquiſitive into the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> of <hi>Aſia.</hi> He Monopoliz'd <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, Syrian</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> Books, and was a profeſs'd <hi>Patron</hi> of <hi>Linguiſts.</hi> He coveted the Acquaintance of <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>Travellers,</hi> that he might by their means Inform himſelf of the different <hi>Laws, Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Religions</hi> of <hi>Foreign Countreys;</hi> and of whatſoever was Rare and worthy of Obſervation, in any <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it was, that I receiv'd Evident Marks of his Eſteem, as ſoon as he knew that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the <hi>Greek, Arabick, Hebrew, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> and <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Languages. He often made uſe of me, as I have ſaid, and gave me free Acceſs to his own and the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Library.</hi> And tho' his <hi>Succeſſor Cardinal
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102963:106"/>Mazarini,</hi> is not ſo much addicted to Studies of this Nature, as to the <hi>Affairs</hi> of <hi>State;</hi> yet he has continued to me, the Priviledge of viſiting this <hi>Treaſury</hi> of <hi>Learned Books,</hi> where I paſs many Hours.</p>
                  <p>One Day I caſt my Eyes on a <hi>Manuſcript</hi> Written in <hi>Arabick,</hi> and endors'd with this <hi>Title,</hi> [<hi>The</hi> Original Covenant <hi>of</hi> Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, <hi>the</hi> Prophet <hi>of the</hi> Arabians, <hi>with the</hi> Profeſſors <hi>of the</hi> Faith <hi>of</hi> Jeſus] and Underneath was a <hi>Latin Inſcription,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, That this <hi>Manuſcript</hi> was found in the <hi>Convent</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Friars</hi> on <hi>Mount Carmel.</hi> I have Tranſcrib'd the <hi>Contents</hi> of this <hi>Parchment,</hi> and ſent it Enclos'd to thee, that thou may'ſt judge whether it be <hi>Real</hi> or onely <hi>Counterfeit.</hi> For, the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it to be the <hi>True Agreement</hi> of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and therefore reproach all the <hi>Moſelmans</hi> with Diſobedience to our <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> and breaking the <hi>League, Sign'd</hi> and <hi>Seal'd</hi> by <hi>Him</hi> whom we call the <hi>Seal</hi> of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Witneſs'd</hi> by the <hi>Four Principal Doctors, Abu Becre, Oſman, Omar</hi> and <hi>Hali.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou wilt peruſe the Enclos'd Paper, it will be eaſy to diſcern, Whether <hi>We</hi> are Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Violation of <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>They.</hi> For, though (ſuppoſing this to be the Real <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> as is pretended) that <hi>Favourite</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> grants many <hi>Articles</hi> of Peace, Aſſiſtance and Friendſhip, to the <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:102963:107"/>of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> with Immunity from Taxes and Impoſitions, Liberty of Conſcience, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Marriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet 'tis evident, that he promis'd not theſe Things, but on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Conditions</hi> to be obſerv'd on the Part of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> as, that None of them ſhou'd harbour, or hold Correſpondence with the Enemies of the <hi>True Believers,</hi> or Privately accommodate 'em with Arms, Horſes, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or any other Neceſſaries of <hi>War:</hi> But, on the Contrary, ſhou'd Hoſpitably receive the <hi>Mofelmans</hi> into their Houſes for Three Days, and Protect 'em from their Enemies. If therefore, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhou'd fail in any of theſe <hi>Points,</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> declares his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to be void, and that they ſhall not enjoy the <hi>Indulgences</hi> granted therein. All this, thou wilt ſee, is recommended ſolemnly to both <hi>Parties,</hi> to be Religiouſly perform'd, till the <hi>Final Conſummation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, all the Diſpute is, Whether <hi>We</hi> have Firſt trangreſs'd theſe <hi>Articles,</hi> or the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes?</hi> For, if it can be prov'd, That they are the Firſt Aggreſſors, then they have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of their Misfortunes, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the <hi>True Faithful</hi> of Oppreſſion and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, as they commonly do; Since it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that they have drawn theſe Evils on themſelves, by their Breach of Faith, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, diſannulling the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Prophet,</hi> and forfeiting the Benefits they might have claim'd by Vertue of it. Be it how it will, the <hi>Prophet</hi> is free from Blame: Let the Guilt reſt on the Perſons that were Criminal.</p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:102963:107"/>
                  <p>I know not how it comes to paſs, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of <hi>this Age,</hi> think and ſpeak more Reproachfully of our <hi>Holy Lawgiver,</hi> than did their <hi>Fathers,</hi> who liv'd in his Time or immediately after it, and who by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence cou'd better inform themſelves of the Circumſtances of his Birth, Life, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Actions. Some Ancient <hi>Writers</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> make Honourable Mention of <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Family.</hi> They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal not the Early Signs of his Heroick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and the Grandeur to which he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd. I have read in a certain <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, That when the <hi>Prophet</hi> was but Nine Years Old, under the Tuition of his Uncle <hi>Abu Taleb,</hi> who carry'd his <hi>Glorious Charge</hi> along with him to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and that whilſt they were at <hi>Boz'r,</hi> a Learned <hi>Monk</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Bohira,</hi> came out of the <hi>Convent</hi> to meet them; and taking <hi>Mahomet</hi> by the Hand in the Preſence of many <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> he ſaid aloud, <hi>This Youth is born to accompliſh Great Things: His Fame ſhall be ſpread from</hi> Eaſt <hi>to</hi> Weſt: <hi>For, as he drew near this Place, I ſaw a bright Cloud deſcend and cover him. Sultan David</hi> alſo Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy'd of him, in that which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> reckon the 50th. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the 2d. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicle:</hi> Where that <hi>Divine Poet</hi> thus Sings, <hi>From Sion God hath proclaim'd the Empire of</hi> Mahomet. But the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted this in another Sence, though the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> remains a ſtanding Witneſs againſt 'em. So <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> uttered a <hi>Myſtery,</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:102963:108"/>when he ſaid, <hi>God came from Sinai, he roſe up from Seir, and was manifeſted from Mount Paran.</hi> Intimating hereby, the <hi>Deſcent</hi> of the <hi>Written Law</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> and of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The <hi>Meſſias</hi> alſo ſaid to his <hi>Diſciples, If I go not away, the Called of God will not come to You.</hi> But the <hi>Chriſtian Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters</hi> wilfully hide theſe Things from the Vulgar, leſt their Eyes ſhou'd be open'd. There appears an Obſtinate Malice and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in all their Actions.</p>
                  <p>Who will not laugh at the fooliſh Spight of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> who, in a certain Town, had a Cuſtom, as oft as they enter'd into the <hi>Church</hi> or came out, to ſpit on a <hi>Black Image</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi> ſitting on an <hi>Aſs,</hi> near the Gate. But a <hi>Muſſulman Embaſſadour</hi> coming thither from the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and obſerving this Vain <hi>Ceremony</hi> of the People, ask'd the <hi>King, What Perſon that Statue repreſented?</hi> He made anſwer, <hi>That it was the Image of Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Arabian Prophet. That cannot be,</hi> reply'd the Embaſſador, <hi>ſince our Prophet never rode but on Camels: It is rather the Figure of the Meſſias, who indeed is recorded to have rode on an Aſs.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> troubl'd at this Anſwer, conſulted the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Men, who all concluded, that the <hi>Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> had ſpoke the Truth. And therefore, inſtead of offering any more Indignities to this <hi>Image,</hi> they fell into another Extreme, and built a <hi>Chappel</hi> for it, burning <hi>Incenſe</hi> to the <hi>Senſeleſs Stock,</hi> and paying it <hi>Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</hi>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:102963:108"/>Thus they Pray'd to that, which but a little before, they had Curs'd; and turn'd into a <hi>God,</hi> that which they had eſteem'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as bad as the <hi>Devil. God</hi>'s Curſe be on the <hi>Devil,</hi> and all his Adorers: But on the <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> and his <hi>Followers,</hi> may Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings ſhower down, and reſt till the <hi>Knot</hi> of the <hi>Spheres</hi> be diſſolv'd.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Hebatolla Mir Argun, Superior <hi>of the</hi> Covent <hi>of</hi> Derviſhes, <hi>at</hi> Cogni <hi>in</hi> Natolia.</head>
                  <p>IT is difficult to define the particular Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of my <hi>Soul,</hi> when I firſt receiv'd the News of thy <hi>Predeceſſor</hi>'s Death, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd and Venerable <hi>Bedredin,</hi> who, as thy <hi>Diſpatch</hi> informs me, is gone to <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> I was neither in Paſſion, nor yet Inſenſible, but wholly Reſign'd to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> I conſider'd his Immenſe Vertues, and the Courſe of <hi>Nature:</hi> His Wonderful Age, and more Admirable Actions, a Life Equally mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd by Hours, and Prodigies of Piety. For, he was not in the Number of thoſe, who let whole Days paſs away, without the leaſt Good Work, or without leaving any <hi>Impreſs</hi> on the <hi>Track</hi> of <hi>Time.</hi> I expreſs my ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Vulgar Saying, <hi>[Time Paſſes away;]</hi> Whereas, in my Opinion, <hi>Time</hi> ſtands ſtill, and only <hi>We</hi> paſs away, with all Things ſubject to Motion and Change. 'Tis like the Miſtake of thoſe who ſailing on the Water, think the Trees and Mountains move, whilſt only they themſelves are driven before the Wind: Or, like the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of thoſe, who truſting to their Groſſer Sence, maintain, the <hi>Sun</hi> whirls daily round our World; tho',
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102963:110"/>according to Reaſon and better <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that <hi>Globe</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> ſtands ſtill, whilſt ours turns round its <hi>Axel-Tree,</hi> and ſo deceives our Eyes. Thus, whilſt we Mortals, glide o'er the uncertain Waves of Humane Life, and paſs by the Viſible and Fixed Land-marks of Time, Day and Night, we imagine thoſe Land-marks move, and not we our ſelves. Whereas, Day and Night remain for Ever, ſtedfaſt and invariable in their Succeſſive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, and only the Elements, and Bodies Compounded of 'em, are ſubject to Change.</p>
                  <p>Minutes, Hours, Days and Years, are not properly the Meaſures of <hi>Time,</hi> but of the Motion and Duration of all Corruptible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: For <hi>Time</hi> is Infinite and beyond all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions. In a Word, 'Tis no otherwiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from <hi>Eternity,</hi> than barely by a Name.</p>
                  <p>All that I have ſaid on this Subject, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the <hi>Arabian Proverb,</hi> which ſays, <hi>To Morrow, is Never.</hi> Doubtleſs, there's no <hi>Paradox</hi> or <hi>Hereſy</hi> in ſaying, <hi>'Tis always To Day;</hi> or that this Hour, this Minute is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. And, from this Truth ſprung the Contemplation of thoſe, who place <hi>Eternity</hi> in a <hi>Point</hi> or <hi>Inſtant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, to return to <hi>Bedredin,</hi> that <hi>Faithful</hi> of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> may his <hi>Soul</hi> repoſe in the <hi>Mercies</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and his Memory be bleſs'd. May <hi>Gabriel,</hi> the <hi>Friend</hi> of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> pray for him; then <hi>Michael, Iſraphiel,</hi> and the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> with all the <hi>Angels</hi> who made <hi>Oraiſons</hi> for the <hi>Divine Favourite,</hi> after
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:102963:111"/>his <hi>Tranſlation</hi> from this <hi>Earthly State.</hi> And, when thou, and the <hi>Religious Fraternity</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy Care, have perform'd the accuſtom'd <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Expiations,</hi> for the Illuſtrious <hi>Prelate</hi> Deceas'd; there is no Queſtion but that he ſhall be in a Condition to Intercede for you, and for the whole <hi>Muſſulman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:</hi> For he was a perfect <hi>Saint,</hi> and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O Sage and Reverend <hi>Succeſſor</hi> of that <hi>Holy Man,</hi> ſuffer me to tell thee, Thy Name, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batolla [the Gift of God,]</hi> fills me with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Preſages of thy Life and Adminiſtration in that Renowned <hi>College,</hi> where the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>Bedredin</hi> ſhin'd ſo many Years. Now he is gone to <hi>God,</hi> and to the Gardens of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Retirement, having left his Seat on Earth to thee, repleniſh'd with the Sacred O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>He was a Religious Imitator of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and of all <hi>Holy</hi> Men in General; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Admirer of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and a Faithful <hi>Diſciple</hi> of the <hi>Sent</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Now he is gone to ſit down with them in the <hi>Chioſcs</hi> of <hi>Eden,</hi> on the Banks of Immortal Streams, the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Wine, Milk and Honey, which glide along the Alleys of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> This is the Recompence of Heroick Vertue, the Crown of Good Works, the Bliſs prepar'd for chaſte and purify'd <hi>Souls,</hi> who in their Tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this Earth, carry no Stains of Vice along with 'em. For, nothing Impure can find Admittance into that <hi>World</hi> of <hi>Glittering Eſſences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:102963:111"/>
                  <p>O <hi>Hebatolla,</hi> what is there on this Obſcure Globe, that deſerves to be compar'd with thoſe Serener Joys Above; Thoſe unſullied Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; That untarniſh'd Bliſs? And yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we taſte ſtrange Felicities here on Earth. But 'tis only when the Gates and Caſements of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> are open, when a Celeſtial Wind tranſports hither the Leaves of the Trees of <hi>Eden,</hi> and perfumes the Air and Skies with the Tranſcendent Odours of that Happy <hi>Region,</hi> wafting alſo Imperfect Sounds, Muſick in ſoft Fragments and <hi>Eccho's,</hi> from the <hi>Quires</hi> of the <hi>Bleſs'd.</hi> Then 'tis, the Hearts of Mortals feel a ſecret and inexpreſſible Joy ſpringing up from the Root; This Lower World (if I may ſo expreſs my ſelf) is all entranc'd with Pleaſure. This happens not every Day, but only at the <hi>Seaſons</hi> of <hi>Divine</hi> Indulgence, on the <hi>Feſtivals</hi> of ſome Particular <hi>Saints,</hi> and in the Time of the Immortal <hi>Jubilee,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> exhilarates the Univerſe with Uncommon Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and an Infinite Largeſs.</p>
                  <p>As for the Reſt of our Enjoyments, they are Mitigations indeed of the Pains and Inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Miſeries of this Mortal Life; They prevail on us to wait the Appointed Hour of <hi>Fate,</hi> and not hurry our ſelves out of the World before our Time: But, they deſerve not to be plac'd in the Rank of true Felicities.</p>
                  <p>However, our Patience under this Fatigue of Life, our Indifference to Pleaſure and Pain, Poverty or Riches, Sickneſs or Health, Honour or Diſgrace, with all the other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Humane Paſſion, will prove a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102963:112"/>Argument of Merit, a prevailing Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to the Life to come, and an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Paſsport to <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> For he that is thus inſenſibly, yet willingly wean'd from the Fulſom Joys of Earth, by the very <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably aſcend to a Purer <hi>Region,</hi> to a Place capable of ſatisfying his Aſpiring <hi>Soul.</hi> For, <hi>Nature</hi> created no Appetite, to baulk it.</p>
                  <p>This is the Life ſo recommended by <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> whoſe Character thou haſt in the <hi>Library</hi> of thy <hi>Convent.</hi> Here I ſend thee in a <hi>Box,</hi> that which by all the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> is eſteem'd his true <hi>Effigies.</hi> I remember, I once ſaw another of the ſame Lineaments, in the <hi>Treaſury</hi> of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> Theſe Pieces are very Rare, becauſe not copy'd by the Hands of Common <hi>Painters,</hi> but by the moſt Celebrated <hi>Maſters</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> And the <hi>Original</hi> Draught, they ſay, was made by the <hi>Meſſias</hi> himſelf on an <hi>Handkerchief,</hi> which he clapt to his Face, and ſo left his lively Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture.</p>
                  <p>I cannot aſcertain the Truth of this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:</hi> But, in Regard this is one of thoſe <hi>Copies</hi> which is Cloſeted by the Greateſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> I ſend it to thee, as a worthy Ornament of thy <hi>Cell,</hi> without either the Peril, or Scandal of <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pious <hi>Bedredin,</hi> was Covetous of any <hi>Memoirs</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> whether written in <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> or in the more uſual Characters of Speech. He wou'd have made no more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception at a <hi>Picture,</hi> than at a <hi>Poem,</hi> in Praiſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102963:112"/>of that <hi>Holy Prophet.</hi> And, I queſtion not, but thou equalleſt him in the ſame Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>I cou'd not ſo eaſily procure the true <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> Surnam'd the <hi>Waſher;</hi> but here I will give thee a ſhort Hiſtory of his <hi>Life.</hi> This was a Famous <hi>Prophet,</hi> who liv'd in the Days of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and was of the <hi>Race</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> His Habitation was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in the <hi>Deſert;</hi> for, he was an <hi>Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,</hi> and liv'd in a <hi>Cave</hi> on one of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Judaea.</hi> Some of the <hi>Jews</hi> took him for <hi>Elias,</hi> others for the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and a Third Sort ſaid he was <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whoſe coming was foretold in the <hi>Book</hi> of their <hi>Law,</hi> and in the <hi>Writings</hi> of their <hi>Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>John</hi> deny'd that he was any of theſe, calling himſelf in Modeſty, <hi>A Voice,</hi> or <hi>Eccho.</hi> His Life was very Abſtemious. For, he fed only on the Tops of Plants, and wild Honey, drinking Nothing but Water of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which ran by the Side of his <hi>Cave.</hi> And his Body was onely cover'd with a Veſt of <hi>Camels</hi> Hair, uſing a Leathern Thong for a Girdle.</p>
                  <p>To that <hi>Solitary</hi> Reſidence of his, there was great Reſort of People from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Cities round about. For the Fame of his Sanctity had ſpread through all <hi>Paleſtine</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He Waſh'd his <hi>Diſciples</hi> with his own Hands in the Waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> from whence he was call'd the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> or <hi>Waſher.</hi> He daily preach'd <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Good Works</hi> to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102963:113"/>the Incredulous <hi>Jews;</hi> and openly declar'd, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> was the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> That <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> it ſeems, was one of <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Diſciples,</hi> and had been Waſh'd by him in the River <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, after many Years of Heroick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety, <hi>John</hi> had his Head cut off by the Order of <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Judaea,</hi> becauſe he had reprov'd the <hi>Tyrant,</hi> for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his Brother's Wife.</p>
                  <p>Behold, theſe <hi>Memoirs</hi> are the beſt Preſents, the Poor Exil'd <hi>Mahmut</hi> can ſend thee, when he Congratulates thy Acceſſion to that <hi>Holy Chair.</hi> Yet, ſuch as theſe, were more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to thy <hi>Predeceſſor,</hi> than Gifts of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Gold or Precious Stones: For, he was a diligent Collector of Choice <hi>Antiquities,</hi> and Select <hi>Fragments</hi> of <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Liberal Patron and Encourager of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> and all Sorts of <hi>Learning.</hi> Follow thou his Example, and the <hi>True Faithful</hi> will be eternally oblig'd to thee. Thou haſt a fair Opportunity, there being, as I'm inform'd, the beſt <hi>Library</hi> in thy <hi>Convent,</hi> of any throughout the <hi>Muſſulman Empire.</hi> And, the <hi>Derviſhes</hi> under thy Government, are Men addicted to the Study of the <hi>Sciences.</hi> 'Tis Pity ſuch Inclinations ſhou'd want Encouragement, whilſt the <hi>Infidels</hi> are every where buſie in Founding New <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and Augmenting the Old. There is one lately erected in the <hi>Dukedom</hi> of <hi>Cleve</hi> by the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> where the <hi>Oriental Languages</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> are profeſs'd.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102963:114"/>took great Delight to walk on the Shore in the Evenings, and obſerve the Setting of the Sun. This Cuſtom of his produc'd various Thoughts in his Breaſt. But, what was of moſt Import, his Reaſon ſuggeſted to him, That it cou'd not conſiſt with the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> that the <hi>Sun,</hi> after he left Our <hi>World,</hi> ſerv'd only to give Light to the Fiſhes, or gild the Waves of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Ocean.

On the Third Day, the Boy on the Main Top-Maſt ſaw a Fire, and within a few Hours afterwards they came within View of <hi>Land.</hi>

                  <p>THis following <hi>Summer,</hi> if all Reports be true, is like to afford ſome Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnes of Blood. The General Diſcourſe here is, that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> will ſpeedily have an Army of Three Hundred Thouſand Men in the Field: Part to act in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Candy,</hi> againſt the <hi>Venetians;</hi> the Reſt to be employ'd againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Enemies of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That ſawcy <hi>Embaſſador, Iſmael Bir Couli Can,</hi> deſerv'd the Puniſhment was Inflicted on him for his Impertinent Huff, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Sabre</hi> in Preſence of the <hi>Greateſt Monarch</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> And let it be an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Precedent</hi> to the <hi>Envoys</hi> of <hi>Foreign Princes,</hi> that they may learn a Leſſon of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, when they addreſs to the <hi>Lord</hi> of their <hi>Lords,</hi> and not by Preſumption Incenſe the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:102963:116"/>
                  <p>But 'tis apparent, this <hi>Embaſſador</hi> took Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our Troubles: He ſwell'd with a vain and falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Puiſſance. Beſides, they ſay, his <hi>Maſter</hi> has enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Solemn <hi>League</hi> with the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> againſt the <hi>Shining Empire.</hi> And 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known here, That Two <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> are arriv'd at <hi>Venice</hi> from that Potent <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> of the <hi>North;</hi> And others are expected from <hi>Perſia,</hi> to Negotiate a <hi>Tripartite League</hi> between thoſe <hi>Crowns</hi> and that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> againſt the <hi>Victorious Oſmans.</hi> Hence I ſuppoſe it was, that the Rude <hi>Heretick</hi> took the Boldneſs to commit an Action, which all the <hi>Eaſt</hi> puniſhes with Death. Neither is it any Thing to the Purpoſe, what the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> of theſe <hi>Parts</hi> ſay, <hi>That the Perſons of Embaſſadors are Sacred:</hi> For, much more ſo are the <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>Sovereigns.</hi> And, ſo long as an <hi>Envoy</hi> obeys the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> in only delivering his Meſſage with Reſpect and Civility, that <hi>Law</hi> will protect him from all Injuries. But, if he muſt needs leap over his own Fence, and inſtead of appearing like an <hi>Embaſſador,</hi> he will act the Part of an <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin,</hi> a <hi>Furioſo,</hi> a <hi>Contemner</hi> of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> he can expect no better Treatment, than what is due to his Audacious Inſolence: He throws off with Scorn the Protection that his <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> claims, and in a mad <hi>Bravado</hi> courts the Revenge of the <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Iſmael</hi> has all along been counted a bold Fool, in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Perſia.</hi> He has committed a Thouſand wild Pranks at <hi>Iſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:102963:117"/>more becoming a <hi>Jeſter,</hi> than a Wiſe <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> Yet his <hi>Maſter</hi> ſtill wink'd at his Extravagances, for his Father's Sake, who did many Notable Services to that <hi>Crown;</hi> Among which, his recovering <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahar</hi> from the <hi>Mogul,</hi> was none of the leaſt: It being the onely <hi>Town,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the <hi>Frontiers</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this and other Merits, <hi>Sha Sephi</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd both him and his Son to the moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable <hi>Governments</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> in the <hi>Empire:</hi> Wherein the Old Man acquitted himſelf fairly to the laſt. But this Young <hi>Buffoon</hi> grew unwieldy with too Much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, affronted the <hi>Grandees,</hi> and play'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>King</hi> himſelf, for which he had once like to have been caſt to the <hi>Dogs.</hi> But, at the Interceſſion of ſome of his few Friends, that Puniſhment was remitted and chang'd into <hi>Exile;</hi> whilſt his Enemies made Uſe of his Abſence, to ruine him.</p>
                  <p>They were ſome of the Greateſt <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> who bore him a Grudge, and they had hourly the <hi>King</hi>'s Ear. Which Advantage they made Uſe of to inſinuate ſuch an Ill <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> that he knew no better Way to be handſomely rid of him, than by ſending him on this deſperate <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy</hi> to the <hi>Myſterious Port:</hi> Chuſing rather, that he ſhould fall by the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Command, than by his own, who had reap'd ſo much Benefit from the Services of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:102963:117"/>
                  <p>By this thou may'ſt diſcern, that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> is earneſtly reſolv'd upon <hi>War,</hi> without regarding how his <hi>Herald</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd it, is received: (For that <hi>Embaſſador</hi> deſerves no other <hi>Title,</hi> who comes not with the Accuſtom'd <hi>Preſents</hi> and <hi>Supplications;</hi> but with an Addreſs of a Harſher Style, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Enmity at his very Firſt Approach to the Feet of the Invincible <hi>Sultan Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>After all, it rejoices me to hear, that thou, and the other <hi>Baſſa's</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> are ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aſſiſt our <hi>Great Maſter.</hi> For I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, that from your Perſonal and Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Contributions,</hi> he has receiv'd a Supply of Thirty Millions of <hi>Aſpers,</hi> beſides the Conſtant <hi>Revenues, Cuſtoms, Tributes,</hi> and <hi>Subſidies</hi> of the <hi>Empire.</hi> This is nois'd all over <hi>Chriſtendom:</hi> Yet the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſeem not much to dread the Conſequences of theſe Vaſt Preparations; judging that they will be employ'd elſewhere, than againſt any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> of their <hi>Dominions,</hi> except in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> where theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> truſt to the Strength of their Forts, and the Inacceſſible Heights of Rocks.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>He</hi> that laid the Foundations of the Earth, and cauſes it to tremble when <hi>He</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the ſame <hi>God</hi> form'd the Lofty Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and can level them with the Plains to ſerve the <hi>Followers</hi> of his <hi>Prophet:</hi> Even as the <hi>Stones</hi> came Voluntarily to ſalute the <hi>Divine Meſſenger</hi> himſelf: The <hi>Trees</hi> rowz'd themſelves, as out of a deep Sleep; and the

                  <p>I wiſh I cou'd have been the Relater of better News to my baniſh'd Friend. But perhaps thou haſt heard of his Death already, by ſome Veſſels from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſo 'twill be Needleſs to ſay any Thing as to his Untimely Fate, or the <hi>Tragedies</hi> of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> and <hi>Imperial</hi> City.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems very ſtrange to me, and a Thing Unaccountable, that there can be no Means found out to prevent theſe dangerous <hi>Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of the Soldiers; and that the moſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable <hi>Empire</hi> on Earth, ſhould be thus frequently ſhock'd by her own <hi>Subjects!

Therefore if I may adviſe thee, it ſhall be, to wean thy ſelf from the Trivial Affairs of Mortals. Let not the Natural Fondneſſes which thou may'ſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have for thy former <hi>Courtly</hi> Life in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> return to diſquiet thy <hi>Soul.</hi> A Man may be Happy any where, that knows how to be Contented. <hi>Nature</hi> is ſerv'd with a <hi>Little:</hi> And we ought to eſteem our Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Appetites as Foreigners.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thou may'ſt carve to thy ſelf various Sorts of Felicities in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and render <hi>Caire</hi> as Pleaſant to thee now, as <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was

If thou art for an Active Life, there's Buſineſs enough in that Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous City; and Opportunities are never wanting to a Man that is ready to lay hold of them. Beſides, 'tis the Popular Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of <hi>Egypt,</hi> That whoſoever dwells in it, finds an Employment ſuitable to his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if thou art Melancholy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative, in my Opinion thou cou'dſt not have choſen a <hi>Country</hi> more agreeable to ſuch a Temper.</p>
                  <p>Were I in thy Station, I ſhou'd make fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Viſits to the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> and never be weary of ſearching out the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of thoſe <hi>Admirable Structures.</hi> There is hardly any Thing made by Human Art, which has put me upon more Importunate Studies and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, than the <hi>Original</hi> of theſe <hi>Stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Fabricks.</hi> They far ſurpaſs in Grandeur and Magnificence, the moſt Renown'd <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Empires,</hi> even in the <hi>Zenith</hi> of their moſt Flouriſhing State. And I wou'd fain learn, <hi>When</hi> they were Firſt Erected, by <hi>Whom,</hi> and for <hi>What</hi> Ends? For I cannot believe what <hi>Joſephus</hi> the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Hiſtorian</hi> reports of them, That they were built in the Time of <hi>Moſes</hi> their <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> and that all thoſe of the <hi>Hebrew Nation,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to ſome Hundreds of Thouſands, were employ'd as Slaves in the Work, by the <hi>King</hi> then Reigning in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have perus'd <hi>Herodotus</hi> the <hi>Grecian, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> with <hi>Strabo, Pliny,</hi> and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102963:119"/>other <hi>Writers,</hi> who have all taken great Pains to ſearch into the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids:</hi> Yet after all their Travel in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their Converſe with the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of that <hi>Country,</hi> they ſeem to have received but ſmall Light in this Affair; leaving Things in Uncertainty, and not agreeing in their Accounts. One will have 'em, to be only deſign'd for <hi>Sepulchers</hi> of the <hi>Kings:</hi> Another ſays, they were built by <hi>Joſeph</hi> the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the <hi>Vizir</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that they were the <hi>Granaries</hi> where he laid up Seven Years Proviſion of Corn, againſt the <hi>Famine,</hi> which in his Days afflicted the Earth. Thus they differ in their Sentiments. And our Countryman <hi>Ibn Abd' Alhokm</hi> declares, That when he was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> he cou'd not draw from any of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the leaſt Certainty as to the <hi>Age</hi> of theſe <hi>Pyramids,</hi> or their <hi>Founders.</hi> Which made him conclude, That ſince there was no Memory or Footſteps of Their <hi>Original</hi> left among Men, it is Probable they were built before the <hi>Flood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This agrees exactly with what others of our <hi>Arabian Writers</hi> have deliver'd concerning King <hi>Saurid,</hi> who Reign'd in <hi>Egypt</hi> Three Hundred Years before the <hi>Deluge.</hi> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſtrange Things of this <hi>Prince;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Reſt, That he dreamt, <hi>The Fixed Stars came down from Heaven to the Earth, overturning all Things with the Violence of their Precipitate Fall.</hi> Being much troubl'd at this <hi>Viſion,</hi> he ſent for the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Sages;</hi> who when they were aſſembl'd together in the <hi>King</hi>'s
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102963:120"/>
                     <hi>Palace, Aclimon</hi> their <hi>Cater,</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> told the <hi>King, That a Year before, he had ſeen a Viſion which made a deep Impreſſion on his Mind. For, the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Orbs appeared to deſcend ſo low as to touch the Earth, ſo that the Stars were mingl'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men. Then he lift up his Hands above his Head in his Dream, to keep the Heaven from quite oppreſſing Mortals with its Weight. Whilſt I were in this Poſture,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I addreſs'd my ſelf to the Sun, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſplendent God, to retire with all his Glittering Train of Lights to their Ancient Stations on High. Whereupon, the Sun made Anſwer, When I ſhall have accompliſh'd Three Hundred Circuits, the Heavens will return to their Proper Places.</hi>

                  <p>When <hi>Aclimon</hi> had related this <hi>Viſion,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> commanded the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> to erect a <hi>Scheme</hi> of the Preſent <hi>Configurations</hi> Above, and to tell them what they Preſag'd.

                  <p>Upon the hearing of this, they ſay <hi>King Saurid</hi> commanded the <hi>Pyramids</hi> to be built; carrying all his Riches into them, with the <hi>Tables</hi> of the <hi>Myſterious Sciences,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> and whatſoever was eſteem'd Precious, and Worthy to be preſerv'd from the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deſtruction.</hi> And the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſay, that he commanded theſe Words to be Engraven on them:</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Saurid, <hi>laid the Foundation of the</hi> Pyramids, <hi>and finiſh'd them in Six Years: Yet I Challenge any Future</hi> King, <hi>to demoliſh them in Six Hundred Years; Tho' it be much eaſier to Ruine, than to Build. I cover'd 'em with</hi> Silks; <hi>let any Man after me, cover 'em with</hi> Mats, <hi>if he can.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In thus aſſerting <hi>Saurid</hi> to be the <hi>Founder</hi> of the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> it ought to be underſtood only of ſome of the Greateſt; and that other Succeeding <hi>Princes</hi> (perhaps after the <hi>Flood</hi>) ſpurr'd on with Emulation and Deſire of Glory, built the Reſt: Which is the only Way to reconcile our <hi>Arabian Writers</hi> to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus, Diodorus</hi> and other <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> who aſſign <hi>Cheops</hi> or <hi>Chemnis,</hi> with <hi>Cephren, Chabryis,</hi> and <hi>Mycerinus</hi> the Son of <hi>Chemnis,</hi> as <hi>Founders</hi> of ſome Particular <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramids.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> aſcribe the Building of one to <hi>Rhodope,</hi> a Famous <hi>Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> or at leaſt to ſome of her <hi>Paramours.</hi>

Or, if this be too bold a Stretch, let us conceive them at leaſt much more Ancient and Durable, than they are Generally thought to be.

                  <p>I do not inſiſt on this, to teach thee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereof thou art Ignorant; but to put thee in Mind of the Benefit and Advantage, beſides the vaſt Delight which accrues to a <hi>Nation</hi> by thus preſerving the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of their <hi>Anceſtors.</hi> In which, my <hi>Countrymen</hi> have exceeded the Fidelity and Care of all other <hi>People.</hi>

                  <p>THE Sacred <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>True Believers,</hi> is beſet at this Time with <hi>Infidels, Rebels</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Here are many Rumours ſpread abroad concerning the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the Intereſt they have in the <hi>Baſſa</hi> and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Babylon.</hi> They talk alſo, that ſome Male-contents deſign Things which ought not to be nam'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> has given me Two Ears, and I hear theſe Diſcourſes with both, but I entertain them with one Unchangeable Judgment, That they are only the Whiſpers of Fame, which has a Thouſand Double Tongues. If it be true, that the Four <hi>Chiauſes</hi> who were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd to <hi>Babylon</hi> from the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to confirm the Inhabitants of that City in their Allegiance, and aſſure them of ſpeedy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, were Murder'd by the diſloyal Citizens; I doubt not but 'tis as true, That the <hi>Plague</hi> has conſum'd the Greateſt Part of the <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads</hi> in their <hi>Camp</hi> at <hi>Aranſacat.</hi> What tho' theſe <hi>Babylonian</hi> Mungrels cry, <hi>Long Live the King of Perſia!</hi> The reſt of the <hi>Empire</hi> with true Zeal and Devotion, pray for the Health and Proſperity of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> What
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102963:128"/>tho' the <hi>Sultan</hi> has ſworn by <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Throne,</hi> by the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> That he will go againſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> in Perſon! The <hi>Mufti</hi> can eaſily abſolve him in Caſe of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Neceſſity, when his Preſence is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite againſt the more Accurſed <hi>Kyſilbaſchi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis probable, the <hi>Oſman Monarchy</hi> may be much embaraſs'd by <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Troubles, and Foreign Wars: Yet he that founded it, and is the <hi>Conſervator</hi> of <hi>Ages,</hi> will out of theſe very Diſtempers and Evils, produce a good Conſtitution of Health in the <hi>State,</hi> and a Firmer Eſtabliſhment againſt all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Venetians</hi> are very buſy in their Levies at Home, and in making Intereſts abroad. <hi>Couriers</hi> are perpetually poſting up and down <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> to and from that City. They wou'd willingly have all the Buſineſs of <hi>Europe</hi> ſuperſeded for their Sakes. Every where 'tis whiſper'd, There's ſome Grand Deſign a foot againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> but no body knows what. And I tell thee, <hi>France, Spain, Germany, Poland, Sueden,</hi> and the Reſt of the <hi>Nazarene Kingdoms,</hi> are too much entangl'd among themſelves, to have any Thoughts of medling with Remote Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Poles</hi> wou'd have had the <hi>German Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> taken that <hi>Crown</hi> in Vaſſalage, on Condition of Protecting it from the <hi>Suedes.</hi> But, whilſt the <hi>Emperour</hi> was alive, he weigh'd the Difficulties, and refus'd ſo Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able an Offer. Now, he is lately dead, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102963:128"/>the <hi>Empire</hi> is hardly capable to defend it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Differences are newly riſen between the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the <hi>Elector Palatine</hi> of <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delburg;</hi> each claiming the Right to be <hi>Vicar</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> during the <hi>Vacancy.</hi> And they are preparing on both Sides, to diſpute the Matter with the Sword: Whilſt the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sueden</hi> ſmiles ſecretly at their <hi>Inteſtine</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, reſolving to be reveng'd on <hi>Germany,</hi> for the Aſſiſtance they have given to <hi>Caſimir King</hi> of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ſame Time, the <hi>Danes</hi> are Arming and Equipping by Sea and Land, to Demand Juſtice of the <hi>Suedes.</hi> Whilſt the cunning <hi>Moſcovite</hi> ſtands aloft, amuſing all Parties with ſpecious Pretexts, but deſigning only to play his own Game, and eſpouſe that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, which will bring him moſt Booty. <hi>Prince Ragotski,</hi> promiſes fair to the <hi>Suedes,</hi> but 'tis thought, will prove falſe in the End. The Counſels of theſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed,</hi> are full of Treachery; They are infatuated, blinded, and know not what they do.</p>
                  <p>The Caſe is as bad in <hi>Spain,</hi> where the <hi>King</hi> is making vaſt Preparations to enter <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> and claim that <hi>Crown,</hi> hoping to make Advantage of their <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> Factions ſince the Death of <hi>Dom Juan de Braganza,</hi> the late <hi>Portugueſe</hi> King: Not conſidering, that the <hi>French</hi> are like to find him Work enough in <hi>Italy, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Catalonia;</hi> beſides the Continual Damages he receives by Sea from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Loſſes he ſuſtains in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:102963:129"/>I tell thee in a Word, all <hi>Europe</hi> is at this Time in ſuch a Hurly-Burly, that they have no Leiſure to attend our Motions in the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> every <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>State</hi> being wholly buſy'd in their own Affairs.

                  <p>There is like to be a New Quarrel between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> The latter complaining, that they have had above Three Hundred <hi>Merchant</hi> Ships taken from 'em by the <hi>French</hi> within theſe Seven Years.

                  <p>I Have encounter'd a Paſſage in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Firſt <hi>Caliphs,</hi> which a little entangles me. My <hi>Faith</hi> is disjoynted. Thou know'ſt, we <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> believe, that <hi>Abu Becre</hi> was the True <hi>Succeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Prophet.</hi> Yet when I conſider, that he attain'd the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> by Surprize without the Conſent of the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> I know not what to think of it.</p>
                  <p>After the Death of the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medina</hi> rais'd a Sedition, and took up Arms, each Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging the Right of <hi>Election</hi> to themſelves. When, to prevent the Ill Conſequences of this Tumult, <hi>Abu-Becre</hi> and <hi>Omar</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately came to them; and to end the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, <hi>Omar</hi> ſtretching forth his Hand to <hi>Abu-Becre,</hi> ſaluted him <hi>Caliph,</hi> and lifting up his Hand to <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſwore <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him. Which Example ſuddenly prevail'd on others, and ſo the Tumult was appeas'd. Yet, <hi>Omar</hi> himſelf ſeem'd to repent of what he had done: For a while after he was heard to ſay, <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly, the Inauguration of Abu-Becre was a Raſh, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nadvis'd Thing; God avert the Evil which may reſult from it. But, let it be a Law, That if any one hereafter ſhall preſume
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102963:130"/>to do as I have done, and ſwear Fealty to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without the Aſſent of the Muſſulmans, he ſhall be put to Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, that which is of greateſt Moment with me, is, that <hi>Ali Eb'n Abi Taleb</hi> the <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-Law</hi> of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> was not preſent at this <hi>Election,</hi> who had as much Right to the <hi>Caliphate,</hi> as any of them, if not more: At leaſt he had a Right to Vote. And when he firſt heard the News, he proteſted againſt what they had done as Null and Invalid, in Regard they had not conſulted him. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, <hi>Ali Eb'n Abi Taleb</hi> was a Matchleſs <hi>Hero,</hi> performing <hi>Miracles</hi> of Valour in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Prophet.</hi> When he beſieg'd <hi>Chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> a City of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he took the Gates of the City from off their Hinges, and us'd them as his Shield. When he brandiſh'd his Glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Sword, he made his Enemies tremble. I will not ſay more in his Praiſe, leſt thou ſhould'ſt conclude, I have liſted my ſelf in the Number of the <hi>Kyzil Baſhi.</hi> What I write, is only by Way of Scrutiny, being diſſatisfi'd about theſe Things.</p>
                  <p>So when <hi>Abu-Becre</hi> lay on his Death-bed, he call'd for <hi>Othman Eb'n Aphan</hi> the <hi>Scribe,</hi> and bid him write as follows: <q>In the Name of <hi>God,</hi> Gracious and Merciful; This is the <hi>Teſtament</hi> of <hi>Abdollah Eb'n Abu Koha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> when he was arriv'd to the Laſt Hour of this World, and the Firſt of the World to come.</q> Then he fell into a <hi>Trance,</hi> while <hi>Othman</hi> proceeded, and wrote the Name of <hi>Omar Eb'no'l Chattab.</hi> Then <hi>Abu-Becre</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:102963:131"/>awak'd; and asking <hi>Othman, Whom he had named for his Succeſſor;</hi> He reply'd, <hi>Omar. Thou haſt done well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and according to my Mind. Yet, if thou hadſt named thy ſelf, aſſuredly, thou art worthy of the Honour.</hi> Thus <hi>Omar</hi> ſucceeded in the <hi>Caliphate,</hi> by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Order of <hi>Abu-Becre,</hi> without asking the Conſent of the <hi>Moſelmans.</hi> It looks like a Contrivance or Bargain between theſe Two at Firſt. When <hi>Omar</hi> ſwore <hi>Fealty</hi> to <hi>Abu-Becre,</hi> one wou'd ſuſpect he made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to bequeath the <hi>Caliphate</hi> to him. Be it how it will, thou ſeeſt <hi>Omar</hi> accepted the <hi>Government,</hi> on Conditions which he himſelf had made Unlawful, when he prohibited any <hi>Succeſſion</hi> that would be made without the Conſent of the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> He was the Firſt that was call'd <hi>Amiro'lmumenin,</hi> or <hi>Commander</hi> of the <hi>Faithful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is reported, that when <hi>Omar</hi> was near his Death, thoſe that ſtood about him deſir'd him to name his <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> they themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending <hi>Ali Eb'n Abi Taleb,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>Relation</hi> to the <hi>Prophet.</hi> But he rejected him, and committed the <hi>Election</hi> of his <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor</hi> to <hi>Othman, Ali, Telha, Azobair, Abu Obeid,</hi> and <hi>Saad Eb'n Abi Wakka. Abu Obeid</hi> therefore coming to <hi>Ali Eb'n Abi Taleb,</hi> ſaid thus to him, <hi>Art thou he to whom I may ſwear Fidelity, that thou wilt act according to the Book of God, and the Laws of his Prophet, and the Conſtitutions of the Two Seniors? Ali</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>I will ever act according to the Book of God, and the Law of his Prophet; but as to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102963:131"/>of the Two Seniors, I will follow my own Counſel.</hi> Then <hi>Abu Obeid</hi> going to <hi>Othman,</hi> ſaid the ſame Words: And <hi>Othman</hi> promis'd to perform all that they requir'd. So they choſe <hi>Othman</hi> to ſucceed <hi>Omar</hi> in the <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phate.</hi> He was accus'd of too great Partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to thoſe of his <hi>Blood;</hi> For he recall'd <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem Ebne'l As Eb'n Omaih,</hi> whom the <hi>Prophet</hi> had baniſh'd. He gave him alſo a Hundred Thouſand <hi>Aſpers,</hi> and to <hi>Abdalla Eb'n Chaled,</hi> he gave Forty Thouſand. They tax'd him alſo with Pride, in that he ſate in the Higheſt <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Prophetick Throne,</hi> where none but the <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> himſelf had ever ſate: For, <hi>Abu-Becre,</hi> in Reverence to the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ſate <hi>One</hi> Step below it, and <hi>Omar, Two.</hi> So that the <hi>Arabians</hi> being Incens'd at <hi>Oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Arrogance and other Vices, took up Arms, and kill'd him. Then ſucceeded <hi>Ali.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I rehearſe this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> to thee, that thou may'ſt know the particular Grounds of my Diſſatisfaction, and give me thy Opinion in this Matter. For, if <hi>Abu-Becre, Omar,</hi> and <hi>Othman,</hi> were Unlawfully lifted to the <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phate,</hi> it follows, that they were <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> and <hi>Hali</hi> the only <hi>True Succeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Prophet.</hi> And, if this be granted, then we have no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Curſe the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who are the <hi>Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of <hi>Hali.

                  <p>BY the Notices which I receive from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> it appears that the Ground of all the <hi>Publick</hi> Diſcontents in that City, is the <hi>Venetians</hi> Conqueſt and Poſſeſſion of <hi>Tenedos:</hi> As if the People thought that <hi>Iſland</hi> wou'd prove as Fatal now to the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> as it was formerly to Old <hi>Troy,</hi> when the <hi>Grecians</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> pitch'd their Firſt Camp there, to recover <hi>Helena</hi> the Faireſt Woman of <hi>Greece,</hi> whom <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Troy</hi> had Raviſh'd from her Husband's Embraces.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Rape</hi> was Fatal to the <hi>Trojans:</hi> For, after a Ten Years War, their City was taken by Stratagem, and burnt to Aſhes: Their <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> either all ſlain, or carry'd away Captives by the Victorious <hi>Greeks.</hi> Onely <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſav'd his <hi>Father</hi> alive, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him on his Back out of the Flames, and with ſome other <hi>Commanders,</hi> eſcap'd to Sea in ſuch Veſſels as they found ready. The <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi>
                     <pb n="392" facs="tcp:102963:132"/>of all his <hi>Adventures,</hi> is too tedious for a <hi>Letter.</hi> Suffice it to ſay, that after many Voyages from one <hi>Region</hi> to another, at laſt he landed in <hi>Italy,</hi> where he and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſetled; And from them the <hi>Venetians,</hi> with other People of <hi>Europe,</hi> derive their <hi>Original.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis this make their preſent Poſſeſſion of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> appear as an Ill <hi>Omen,</hi> in the Eyes of the <hi>Superſtitious.</hi> As if thoſe Reliques of <hi>Ancient Troy,</hi> were now come to recove the <hi>Habitations</hi> of <hi>Fathers,</hi> and drive both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> out of the <hi>Empire</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, theſe are onely <hi>Chimaera's,</hi> and Dreams; For, when a <hi>Nation</hi> is once diſplanted from their <hi>Native</hi> Seat, they ſeldom or never take <hi>Root</hi> there again.

                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:102963:133"/>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Trojan</hi> War is in my Mind, I cannot but ſmile at the Egregious Folly of <hi>Ajax,</hi> the Son of <hi>Telamon.</hi> This was a Great <hi>Commander</hi> in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army, a huge, brawny, Giant-like Fellow, that had perform'd Prodigies of Strength and Valour in combating the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and yet at laſt, fell upon his own Sword and kill'd himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cou'd not have his Will of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes;</hi> and all about an Old Ruſty <hi>Buckler,</hi> taken from the Enemy, which <hi>Ajax</hi> claim'd as his Right, in Reward of his Meritorious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and the many Scars he had receiv'd. But <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> over-rul'd the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> which was call'd on Purpoſe to decide this Quarrel, and got the <hi>Shield</hi> himſelf. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cunning, plauſible Fellow, he pleaded, That though the Courage and brave Actions of <hi>Ajax</hi> deſerv'd all due Honour and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment; yet the Surprize of <hi>Troy</hi> and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War, was onely owing to his Wit and Contrivance, who deluded the <hi>Trojans</hi> with a <hi>Wooden Horſe,</hi> in the Belly of which lay a Detachment of Armed Men; and theſe, after the <hi>Horſe</hi> was admitted into the City, came out of their Neſt in the Dead of the Night, and ſet Fire to the Houſes, opening the Gates alſo to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Venetians</hi> cou'd invent ſome ſuch Stratagem, perhaps there wou'd be Danger of their taking <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> But, till then, Illu ſtrious <hi>Baſſa,</hi> there's no Reaſon to fear theſe <hi>Infidels.</hi> Beſides, it will be very eaſy to diſpoſſeſs 'em of that Ominous <hi>Iſland,</hi> and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102963:133"/>ſo diſſipate the Charm which has bewitch'd the Seditious Rabble. But I wou'd counſel, that it be attempted in Time, before the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> are got into the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> with their <hi>Navy:</hi> For, there's no Succeſs againſt theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> by Sea. That <hi>Element,</hi> it ſeems, is the <hi>Wife</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> being E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpous'd with a <hi>Ring</hi> and other Solemn <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> on a certain <hi>Feſtival</hi> of the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One wou'd think alſo, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had made ſucceſsful Love to the Sea; For, their <hi>Navies</hi> are always proſperous. We have freſh News come in, of an Encounter between them and the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-India</hi> Fleet, near the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Teneriff;</hi> wherein there were Seventeen of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships ſunk and burnt, and among them were Five great Galleons. They took from them an Immenſe Treaſure of Gold and Silver, with other coſtly Merchandiſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French Court</hi> rejoyces mightily at this Exploit; not in any Real Love to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> but in Hatred of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For, between theſe Two <hi>Nations,</hi> there ſeems to be an Irreconcilable <hi>Antipathy.</hi> Beſides, the <hi>French</hi> have Reaſon of <hi>State</hi> for their Joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>League</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which renders this Victory the more Remarkable, is, that it was obtain'd in a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Harbour, the <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>Santa Cruz</hi> in <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriff.</hi> Every one extols the <hi>Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi> for a very brave Perſon.

                     <hi>To</hi> Nathan Ben Saddi, <hi>a</hi> Jew <hi>at</hi> Vienna.</head>
                  <p>THE Beginning of thy Letter ſurpriz'd me with wonder, when I Read that a <hi>Chiaus</hi> from the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> the <hi>Sovereign</hi> of <hi>Sovereigns, Lord</hi> of Three <hi>Empires,</hi> and Five and Twenty <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> ſhou'd have the Diſhonour, not to find Admittance within the Walls of <hi>Vienna;</hi> and that in a Time when the <hi>Germans</hi> have no Reaſon to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a <hi>Foreign</hi> War, being ſufficiently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs'd with <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Troubles. But, when I read farther, and perceiv'd, That no <hi>Embaſſador,</hi> not even of the <hi>Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> has any more Privilege at this Juncture; and that it is an Eſtabliſh'd <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> thus to reverence the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of their deceas'd <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and conſult the Safety of the next <hi>Election;</hi> I ceas'd to reſent this any longer as an Indignity to our <hi>Great Maſter,</hi>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:102963:135"/>and only concluded it to be ſome <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Auſtrian State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an Argument of profound Reſpect to the <hi>Imperial Ghoſt,</hi> That the <hi>Churches</hi> are all hung with <hi>Mourning,</hi> throughout the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Dominions,</hi> and that no <hi>Muſick</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted either in the <hi>Temples</hi> or elſewhere; no Jollity or Mirth, till the <hi>Funeral Obſequies</hi> are perform'd, and the Body of <hi>Caeſar</hi> is conſign'd to the Place of its Everlaſting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the Quarrel between the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> and <hi>Prince Palatine,</hi> about the <hi>Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riate;</hi> there's much to be ſaid on both Sides: And it ought to be a Thing Indifferent to thee and me, which of thoſe Two gets the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Yet, for the Sake of Truth, I will tell thee in Short, what I have collected out of the <hi>Journal</hi> of <hi>Carcoa,</hi> thy <hi>Predeceſſor,</hi> and out of other <hi>Memoirs,</hi> as they came to my Hands.</p>
                  <p>It appears then, that by the <hi>Golden Bull</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> V. this <hi>Dignity</hi> was declar'd Inherent in the <hi>Palatinate Family,</hi> in Right of their <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of that <hi>Principality;</hi> and that it had been ſo for many Ages, even before there were any <hi>Electors</hi> Eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>Empire.</hi> 'Tis upon this Ground the preſent <hi>Elector Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi> claims it. But on the other Side, it is as manifeſt, that when <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Preſent <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the <hi>Electoral Dignity,</hi> it was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the <hi>Imperial Bull,</hi> that the <hi>Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> during an <hi>Interregnum,</hi>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:102963:135"/>ſhou'd henceforth belong to that <hi>Family.</hi> Yet, this <hi>Grant</hi> was again diſannull'd by the late <hi>Pacification</hi> at <hi>Munſter.</hi> And ſo the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is left in Diſpute between theſe Two <hi>Families.</hi> He of <hi>Bavaria</hi> truſts to his Strength and Riches, being alſo back'd by the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Princes;</hi> whilſt the other only confides in the Juſtice of his Cauſe, the Right of Unqueſtionable Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Leaving therefore theſe <hi>Grandees</hi> to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their ſeveral <hi>Claims,</hi> I'll tell thee, what makes the freſheſt Noiſe in this City, is an Attempt which the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> made lately on the Town of <hi>Calais,</hi> a <hi>Sea-Port</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom.</hi> He had receiv'd certain Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that the <hi>Governour</hi> had ſent out the beſt Part of the Garriſon to fortify <hi>Ardres,</hi> a Place not far from <hi>Calais,</hi> and ſuppos'd to be in greater Danger; Upon this News, the <hi>Prince</hi> march'd with great Expedition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to ſurprize <hi>Calais</hi> by Night. But he was diſcover'd before he came near them; and the Inhabitants taking up Arms, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Walls and Ramparts to welcome him, ſo that he was forc'd to retire again with the Loſs of near a Thouſand Men.</p>
                  <p>Here are Two Men come out of <hi>England,</hi> that pretend to be <hi>Prophets,</hi> foretelling the Downfal of the <hi>Pope,</hi> whom they call <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> a <hi>Dragon,</hi> and I know not how many other Titles. One of them is gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> to tell the <hi>Holy Father</hi> to his Face what is like to befall him. The <hi>French Court</hi> looks upon them as Mad Men; and no Body
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102963:136"/>can eſteem them better, if they go to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they will Infallibly fall into the Hands of the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> which, thou know'ſt, is a <hi>Hell</hi> upon <hi>Earth.</hi> Thy Brother <hi>Adonai</hi> felt the Smart of it, only for Two or Three Words, utter'd in Contempt of their <hi>Religion;</hi> And tho' he was not Condemn'd to Death, yet he ſuffer'd a tedious Impriſonment; till at Length, the <hi>Plague</hi> releas'd, him both from that, and the <hi>Chains</hi> of this Mortal Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nathan,</hi> if he had dy'd by the Stroke of the <hi>Executioner,</hi> or by <hi>Fire,</hi> the Common Death of thoſe who rail at the <hi>Roman Faith,</hi> I cou'd not pronounce him a <hi>Martyr,</hi> unleſs it were to his own Folly and Raſhneſs; ſince he was not plac'd there to make <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> either to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the Secret Tranſactions of the <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

                  <p>I Welcome thy Return to the Earth again: For it appears by thy Letter, that thou haſt been in the <hi>Other World.</hi> 'Twere to be wiſh'd, thou woud'ſt favour the <hi>Living,</hi> with a <hi>Journal</hi> of thy <hi>Travels</hi> and <hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> among the <hi>Dead.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Regions</hi> of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> wou'd afford Matter of Noiſe enough to Mortals, that are always greedy of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign News. Perhaps if thou wou'dſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Remarks thou haſt made du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Ramble of thy <hi>Soul,</hi> we might find out ſome Method of Correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Our World,</hi> and that <hi>Inviſible State.</hi> We might contrive a Way to ſend <hi>Diſpatches</hi> to our Friends, and to receive their Anſwers again. Or, at leaſt we might make ſome Uſeful Diſcoveries, in that <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But tell me ſeriouſly, doſt thou think that it was any more than a <hi>Trance</hi> or <hi>Dream</hi> that has happen'd to thee? Such as frequently falls out in <hi>Melancholy Conſtitutions?</hi> I once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd <hi>Cara Hali</hi> the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> of ſuch an Accident as this not far from <hi>Paris.</hi> It was of a Man that had lain Five and Thirty Hours as Dead, in all Humane Apperance, and ſo given over by the <hi>Phyſicians:</hi> Yet after that Period, he recover'd his <hi>Sences</hi> again, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102963:137"/>told ſtrange Things to thoſe that were about him. Surely, theſe are but the <hi>Slumbers</hi> of the <hi>Soul;</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf is but a <hi>deeper Sleep,</hi> when it cauſes the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of the <hi>Body.</hi> Doubtleſs, Men awake again in ſome other <hi>Active State.</hi> For, as a Flame of Fire is Equally diſpos'd to embody it ſelf in the Fat of Fleſh or Fiſh, in Oyl, Wax, Sulphur, or any Proper Vehicle; and as ſoon as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd in One, will readily tranſlate it ſelf ſucceſſively to all the Reſt, if they be within the <hi>Sphere</hi> of its <hi>Activity</hi> (as the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Philoſophers</hi> ſpeak:) So is the <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Flame</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> always in a Poſture of <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration.</hi> For ought we know, he that is a <hi>King This</hi> Hour, may be a <hi>Peacock</hi> the <hi>Next,</hi> and within a <hi>Few Days</hi> be ſerv'd up at his <hi>Succeſor</hi>'s Table, as a <hi>Royal</hi> Diſh.</p>
                  <p>But not to inſiſt too much on theſe Secrets, I will relate to thee a Paſſage, not unlike that thou haſt Experienc'd.</p>
                  <p>It is Recorded in the <hi>Writings</hi> of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Pen, the <hi>Manuſcript</hi> of an Ancient <hi>Arabian,</hi> That <hi>Al' Raſhid, Emperour</hi> of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> had many Famous <hi>Phyſicians</hi> about him. Among the Reſt, he highly eſteem'd <hi>Salch Eb'n Nahali,</hi> an <hi>Indian,</hi> for recovering one his near <hi>Kinſmen,</hi> out of ſuch a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as I ſuppoſe thou haſt been in. That <hi>Kinſman</hi> was very dear to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> who was ſitting at a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> when News was brought him that he was dead. The <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> extremely troubl'd to hear this, burſt forth into Tears, and caus'd the Table to be
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:102963:137"/>taken away. Then <hi>Jaafer Eb'n Yahya,</hi> one of his Confidents, immediately deſir'd that <hi>Saleh</hi> the <hi>Indian Phyſician,</hi> might viſit the <hi>Corps</hi> of his dead <hi>Relation.</hi> Who went ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and having felt his <hi>Pulſe,</hi> and conſider'd him well, he return'd to the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Ceaſe to mourn, my Lord, Commander of the Faithful: For if this Man be dead, and I do not reſtore him to Life again, may I be divorc'd from all my Wives for Ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He had ſcarce made an End of ſaying this, when a Second <hi>Diſpatch</hi> came to the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> from thoſe who were about his <hi>Kinſman,</hi> aſſuring him, That he was really departed this Life.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Al' Raſhid</hi> began to Curſe the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and their Ignorance. But <hi>Saleh</hi> perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in his Aſſertion, crying out with ſome Vehemence, <hi>Be not Incredulous, O Emperour of the Faithful, nor ſuffer thy Kinſman to be buried, till I have been with him again: For aſſuredly, he is not dead. I will ſhew you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is Admirable. Al Raſhid</hi> pacify'd with theſe Words, took <hi>Saleh</hi> along with him to viſit the ſuppos'd dead Perſon.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as they came into his Chamber, the <hi>Indian</hi> took a Needle, and thruſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Nail and the Fleſh of his Left Thumb. Then the Entranc'd ſnatch'd up his Hand toward his Mouth. At which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leh</hi> cry'd out, <hi>Now my Lord comfort your ſelf; for, dead Men uſe not to be ſenſible of Pain,</hi> After this, he blew up a <hi>Powder</hi> into his Noſe. Upon which, in a few Minutes the <hi>Patient</hi>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:102963:138"/>ſneez'd; and ſitting upright in his Bed, ſpoke to <hi>Al' Raſhid,</hi> kiſſing alſo his Hand. The <hi>Emperour</hi> asking him, <hi>How he found himſelf;</hi> He reply'd, <hi>Benefactor of Mankind, I have been in the ſweeteſt Sleep that ever I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber fell on me in my Life. Only I dream'd, that a Dog came and bit me by my Left Thumb, the Pain of which wak'd me.</hi> With that, he ſhew'd him the Mark of the Needle, and the Blood. Adding, <hi>Surely it was no Dream, but a Truth; for I feel it yet.</hi> The <hi>Emperour</hi> was extremely pleas'd with his <hi>Indian Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> and did him great Honour. His <hi>Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> alſo, whoſe Name was <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> liv'd many Years after this, and was made <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he dy'd and was bury'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Eaſtern Phyſicians</hi> have been Famous in all Ages, and are now much in Eſteem among the <hi>Franks,</hi> who addict themſelves to ſtudy the <hi>Sciences.</hi> Here are ſome very Learned <hi>Phyſicians</hi> in theſe <hi>Parts,</hi> and not a few Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ones, who ſerve as Foils, to ſet off the Luſtre and Fame of the others. Every <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> and <hi>City</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> ſwarms with 'em: And they all find Employment either to Kill or Cure. The <hi>Nazarenes</hi> live very Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and fall into Abundance of Diſeaſes, whereof the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is wholly Ignorant: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is Neceſſary for 'em to be well ſtock'd with <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> Yet 'twas <hi>Satyrically</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by a certain <hi>French Lord,</hi> That in a Town not far from his <hi>Palace,</hi> the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were all healthy long-liv'd Men, till a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102963:138"/>certain <hi>Emperick</hi> came and took up his Reſidence there: For then they began to ſicken and die apace. But this may be an Invidious Remark. The <hi>Arabian Proverb</hi> ſays, <hi>No Man is a good Phyſician, but he that is born ſuch:</hi> Meaning, that ſome are <hi>Naturally</hi> diſpos'd and fitted to this <hi>Science.</hi> Indeed, I have known Admirable Cures per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by Men, who never ſtudy'd in the <hi>Academies,</hi> or cou'd anſwer Three Queſtions in <hi>Anatomy.</hi> Nay, ſome Women have a Gift of this Nature, and are very Fortunate in their Practices. But, when all's done, the <hi>Beaſts</hi> are moſt Happy, who are all their own <hi>Phyſicians</hi> by <hi>Inſtinct.</hi>

                     <hi>Melec,</hi> I wiſh thee ſuch a State of Health, as needs no Medicines. But if it be thy Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to fall into <hi>Parmenides</hi> his Indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, I counſel thee to make uſe of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given him by a <hi>Philoſopher;</hi> who, when <hi>Parmenides</hi> complain'd of a Pain in his <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> and ask'd his Advice, he bid him uſe ſuch and ſuch <hi>Confections</hi> and <hi>Electuaries.</hi> The other reply'd, <hi>He had made Tryal of them all, and many more, yet found no Eaſe.</hi> Then ſaid the <hi>Philoſopher, Turn Poet, for they Generally have Good Stomachs.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>COuriers</hi> upon <hi>Couriers,</hi> are come to this City with the Joyful News that <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medi</hi> is ſurrender'd to the <hi>French.</hi> For which, the whole Body of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and City of <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>Chancellour</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> with <hi>Cardinal Antonio Barberini,</hi> and all the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> went to the <hi>Grand Moſch</hi> or <hi>Temple</hi> where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung this After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, with a Pompous Solemnity. And now whilſt I am writing, there is ſuch a Confus'd Noiſe of Great Guns, Ringing of Bells, and Shouts of People, That one wou'd think it were enough to wake the very <hi>Dead,</hi> and make them ſtart from their <hi>Graves,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what's the Matter.</p>
                  <p>The Truth of it is, this Place is counted one of the ſtrongeſt in <hi>Europe;</hi> and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were not Inſenſible of it, when they made their <hi>Conditions</hi> of Honour with the <hi>King.</hi> And therefore we need not wonder at the Exceſſive Joy of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Keys</hi> were deliver'd to the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Deputies</hi> of the Town, one of them in the Name of the Reſt, made this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Addreſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Sire, We ſhould have had juſt Reaſon to complain of Fortune, and accuſe our ſelves of Cowardiſe, if we had ſurrender'd this
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102963:139"/>Impregnable Fortreſs, to the Arms of a <hi>Prince</hi> leſs Glorious and Puiſſant than your <hi>Majeſty:</hi> Since our very Walls are of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Strength to defend us, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Arms, againſt a Power Inferiour to yours. But, in Regard it is the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> that we muſt change our <hi>Maſter,</hi> we rejoice to fall into the Hands of ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible and Generous a <hi>Monarch.</hi> And we hope, Sire, that your <hi>Majeſty</hi> will ſhew us the more Favour, for having us'd our Utmoſt Efforts to conſerve an Inviolate Fidelity to the <hi>Catholick King,</hi> who but Yeſterday was our <hi>Maſter.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was ſpoken with ſo graceful an Action, and ſuch a becoming Frankneſs, that the <hi>King</hi> being mightily pleas'd with them, made them this Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Yes, I ſhall always remember, that your Conſtancy deſerves my Eſteem. And now conſidering you as my <hi>Subjects,</hi> I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſuch Privileges on this City, as ſhall oblige you to manifeſt no leſs Courage and Zeal for my Service, than you have done for the <hi>Catholick King.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to evidence, that he has equal Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Gratitude and Eſteem for his <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> by whoſe Courage and Conduct this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>Place</hi> is come under his Obedience; the <hi>King</hi> has beſtow'd the <hi>Government</hi> of it on the <hi>Lieutenant General</hi> of his Armies, who was preſent at the Siege, and was ſhot in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Places of his Body.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102963:140"/>in Sixteen Sieges and Battels, being mark'd all over with Scars, the Glorious <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſticks</hi> of an Indefatigable and Fortunate <hi>Hero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is fit the <hi>Divan</hi> ſhou'd be inform'd of all ſuch Paſſages: Not to inſtruct them what to do in the like Caſes (for they are Perfectly Wiſe) but that theſe Examples may be Regiſter'd, as Spurs to Vertue and Magnanimity of Spirit. For, it cannot be ſuppos'd, that the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>True Believers</hi> will come ſhort of theſe <hi>Infidel Kings,</hi> in Rewarding his Faithful and Undaunted <hi>Slaves.</hi>

                     <hi>Mareſchal de Ferte Seneterre</hi> has alſo had his Share in the Careſſes and Acknowledgments of the <hi>King</hi> and the whole <hi>Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Succeſs has given a great Damp to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who begin to retire as faſt as they can from the Neighbourhood of the <hi>French</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. On the other Sides, theſe are full of Vigour and brisk Reſolutions; reſolving not to end the Campaign, without ſome farther Attempts in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They creep by Degrees into the very <hi>Heart</hi> of that <hi>Province,</hi> which is ever like to be the Stage of War, ſo long as the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> has one Town left in it. 'Tis a very Rich <hi>Country,</hi> abounding in all the deſirable <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> And the People are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Induſtrious, to learn and improve what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is Profitable in <hi>Art.</hi> All their Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs lies in this, That they are not able to protect themſelves and ſubſiſt Independent of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102963:140"/>one or other of the Neighbouring <hi>Crowns.</hi> So that whenever thoſe <hi>Sovereigns</hi> fall out, theſe Poor People are miſerably oppreſs'd with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and in this Caſe, their Friends many Times give 'em as much Trouble as their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Nay, 'tis difficult to determine, which are their Enemies, and which their Friends. For, to whatſoever <hi>Maſter</hi> they are ſubject, he dreins their Coffers of Money by Taxes and Contributions; beſides the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Vexation of Quartering unruly Soldiers, who commit a Thouſand Inſolences unpuniſh'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poland</hi> is at this Time in as bad a Condition, between the Armies of <hi>Sueden, Auſtria, Brandenburgh, Moſcovy, Tranſylvania,</hi> and the Forces of <hi>King Caſimir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Son of the deceas'd <hi>Emperour,</hi> has ſent a great Army to the Aid of that Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Monarch;</hi> and 'tis confirm'd on all Hands, that they have laid Siege to <hi>Cracow.</hi> Whilſt his <hi>Embaſſador</hi> is Negotiating with the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> to draw him off from the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Intereſt. This is like to prove a <hi>War</hi> of long Continuance, if the <hi>Plague</hi> do not make <hi>Peace;</hi> with rages in thoſe <hi>Parts,</hi> and deſtroys many Thouſands more than the Sword or Gun. The <hi>Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> have Combated with this Diſtemper above theſe Two Years, the <hi>Grand Duke</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forc'd to fly with his Army, like Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, before this Inexorable <hi>Conquerour,</hi> which gives no Quarter.</p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:102963:141"/>
                  <p>In the mean Time, I hear Ill News from <hi>Candia,</hi> where they ſay, the <hi>Moſelmans</hi> have in a Late Attempt on the City, loſt above Four Thouſand Men, with Thirty Four En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and a Conſiderable Treaſure. Theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> have alſo taken and deſtroy'd this <hi>Summer</hi> above Thirty Ships of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and as many more of <hi>Conſtantinople, Smyrna, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo, Scanderoon,</hi> &amp;c. On Board of one of which, they ſeiz'd the Yearly Revenue which comes to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> from <hi>Scanderoon:</hi> And out of another they have taken the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> kill'd a Thouſand <hi>True Believers,</hi> took Half that Number Captives, and releas'd Abundance of <hi>Chriſtian Slaves:</hi> In a Word, they have taken out of the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Veſſels which fell into their Hands, an Immenſe Treaſure of Silver, Gold, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones.</p>
                  <p>Theſe continual Succeſſes of the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes,</hi> wou'd tempt one to think, That this <hi>War</hi> was Unjuſtly commenc'd by <hi>Sultan Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi> and therefore Unhappily carry'd on by his Glorious <hi>Succeſſor, Sultan Mahomet.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Effect of Melancholy, Benign <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> if it be a Crime to think, that the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> of <hi>All Things</hi> is Angry with thoſe who Violate their Solemn Word and Oath. Thou know'ſt the whole Story of this <hi>War,</hi> and the Firſt Occaſions of it. I ſay no more.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Nathan Ben Saddi, <hi>a</hi> Jew <hi>at</hi> Vienna.</head>
                  <p>NOW thou giveſt me ſome Solid Hopes of a <hi>Convert.</hi> Thy Letter has rais'd my Expectation, ſince 'tis not penn'd in a Style full of Scruples and Inſignificant Doubts, which wou'd be Endleſs: Nor yet does it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Hypocriſy and Diſſimulation, as if thou intend'ſt only to mock me and my <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſtill continue thy ſelf an <hi>Infidel.</hi> But it abounds with very fair Conceſſions, <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> on thy Side; Only expecting from me, a True and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Account of our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi>'s Life, and of the <hi>Miracles</hi> which can be produc'd in Confirmation of his <hi>Prophetick Office.</hi> Thou wou'dſt fain ſee, if any Thing happen'd of this Kind, to the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> parallel to the Stupendous Wonders which recommended <hi>Moſes</hi> your <hi>Lawgiver</hi> to the World, as the undoubted <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I proteſt, there is no Fault to be found in this Demand: For it is but Reaſon, that he who aſſumes the <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> ſhou'd be diſtinguiſh'd from <hi>Impoſtors</hi> by ſome Evident Signs and Wonders. Yet, 'tis needleſs to make an exact Parallel, becauſe the Occaſions of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Miracles,</hi> were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102963:142"/>from thoſe of <hi>Mohammed,</hi> the <hi>Seal</hi> of the <hi>Prophets.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Eſſence,</hi> the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> the <hi>Joys</hi> of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,</hi> and the <hi>Torments</hi> of the <hi>Damn'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, leſt the Unbelieving World ſhou'd doubt the Truth of his <hi>Miſſion;</hi> From his very Birth, his Life was grac'd with many <hi>Supernatural</hi> Favours. His Mother bore him without the leaſt Pain of Body or Mind: And as ſoon as he breath'd the Vital Air, he ſpoke with an Audible Voice, ſaluting his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and adding, <hi>I profeſs, That there is only One God, and that I am his Apoſtle.</hi> He was alſo <hi>Circumcis'd</hi> by <hi>Nature,</hi> coming into the World without his <hi>Prepuce.</hi> At the ſame Hour, the <hi>Devils</hi> were forbid to aſcend above the <hi>Orb</hi> of the <hi>Moon:</hi> And <hi>Four Voices</hi> were heard from the <hi>Four Corners</hi> of the <hi>Square Temple:</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> ſaying, <hi>Proclaim, The Truth is riſen, and all Lyes ſhall return into Hell.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> uttering, <hi>Now is born an Apoſtle of your own Nation, and the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is with him.</hi> The Words of the <hi>Third</hi> were, <hi>A Book full of Illuſtrious Light is ſent to you from God.</hi> And the <hi>Fourth Voice</hi> was heard to ſay, <hi>O Mahomet, we have ſent thee to be a Prophet, Apoſtle, and Guide to the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When he was about Four Years Old, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the Sons of his Nurſe into the Field,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102963:143"/>the bleſſed Child retir'd into a <hi>Cave</hi> at the Foot of the Mountain <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riel</hi> to pray: When the <hi>Archangel Gabriel</hi> appear'd to him, and ſaid, <hi>Biſmillahi rrahmani rrahimi,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the Name of God, Compaſſionate and Merciful, O Child greatly beloved, I am ſent to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant from thy Heart, the Root of Evil; for thy Ejaculations made the Gates of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe fly open.</hi> The Young <hi>Reſigned one</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Will of thy Lord and Mine be done.</hi> Then the <hi>Angel</hi> open'd his <hi>Breaſt</hi> with a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor</hi> of <hi>Adamant,</hi> and taking out his Heart, ſqueez'd from it the <hi>Black Contagion,</hi> which was deriv'd from <hi>Adam:</hi> And having put the Child's Heart in his Place again, he bleſs'd him, and retir'd to the <hi>Inviſibles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From that Time the Young <hi>Favourite</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> grew up and proſper'd in all Things, having the Smiles of <hi>God</hi> and Man. He was under the Tuition of his Uncle <hi>Abu-Taleb,</hi> who diſcerning the Marks of an Immenſe <hi>Soul</hi> in his Young Nephew, was more Sollicitous for his Welfare, than if he had been his Son. His Fortune being Low in the World, he had no other Way to provide for his <hi>Illuſtrious Charge,</hi> than by placing him as a <hi>Factor</hi> to <hi>Chadijah,</hi> a Widow of the ſame <hi>Tribe</hi> with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which was the <hi>Nobleſt</hi> among the <hi>Arabians.</hi> Beſides, ſhe was very Beautiful and Rich: And there wanted not Hopes, that in Time ſhe might become <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Wife.</p>
                  <p>That which chiefly encourag'd 'em to this, was a <hi>Viſion</hi> of <hi>Chadijah,</hi> every where talk'd
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102963:143"/>of in thoſe <hi>Parts.</hi> For, ſhe had divulg'd it her ſelf, long before <hi>Mahomet</hi> became her Servant, or his Uncle had any Thoughts of thus diſpoſing of him. <q>The <hi>Sun</hi> ſeem'd to leave his <hi>Heaven</hi> and come down to her Houſe, from whence he diſpers'd his Beams through <hi>Arabia, Egypt, Perſia,</hi> and in fine, through the Whole Earth.</q> This <hi>Viſion</hi> had made a deep Impreſſion on the Mind of <hi>Chadijah;</hi> and ſhe cou'd not reſt, till ſhe had told it to a certain Famous <hi>Sage</hi> in thoſe <hi>Parts,</hi> who had great Skill in <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> and other <hi>Myſterious Sciences,</hi> and was <hi>Celebrated</hi> for the Integrity of his Manners. As ſoon as he heard the Contents of her <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he ſaid, <q>In the Name of <hi>God,</hi> O Widow, enter into thy <hi>Bath,</hi> and prepare thy ſelf with the Neceſſary <hi>Purifications:</hi> For, thou ſhalt ſhortly be married to the Greateſt <hi>Prophet</hi> in the World.</q> And when ſhe ask'd the <hi>Aſtrologer, What was the Country, Tribe, and Name of her next Husband?</hi> He told her, <hi>He was an</hi> Arabian <hi>of</hi> Mecca, <hi>of the Tribe of the</hi> Corei's <hi>and that his Name was</hi> Mahomet.</p>
                  <p>As yet, the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Widow knew No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Nephew of <hi>Abu-Taleb.</hi> But, thou may'ſt imagine ſhe felt ſtrange Paſſions, when his Uncle afterwards recommended him to her Service; and ſhe knew, that he was the Man in whom the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi>'s Character was verifi'd, as to his <hi>Country, Tribe</hi> and <hi>Name.</hi> For, <hi>Mahomet</hi> was the Son of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalla,</hi> who deſcended from the <hi>Bani Haſchim,</hi>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:102963:144"/>who were the <hi>Nobleſt Family</hi> in the <hi>Tribe</hi> of the <hi>Corei's.</hi> Who can expreſs her Sentiments, when ſhe ſaw the Beautiful Youth making his Firſt Addreſſes to her as an humble <hi>Slave,</hi> whom ſhe believ'd <hi>Heaven</hi> had ordain'd for the <hi>Partner</hi> of her <hi>Bed?</hi> With what a Grace and becoming Modeſty, did he receive the laſt Inſtructions and Farewel of his parting Uncle? However, ſhe conceal'd her Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports, and ſent her beloved <hi>Slave</hi> with a <hi>Caravan</hi> into <hi>Syria,</hi> allowing him a Noble <hi>Penſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In that Journey, there happen'd ſomething very Remarkable in Honour of the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Young Man. For at a certain Place on the Road, as he waited on the Captain of the <hi>Caravan</hi> to a <hi>Synagogue</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> no ſooner had <hi>Mahumed</hi> ſet his Foot o'er the Threſhold of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> but all the Lamps therein were looſen'd from their Chains, and fell down on the Floor. All thoſe of thy <hi>Nation</hi> that were preſent, being aſtoniſhed at the Portentous Accident, fell at the Feet of the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> deſiring their Advice in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing Circumſtance. They having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the accuſtom'd <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>It is revealed in the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Seniors, That at what Time ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an Arabian, call'd Mahomet, ſhall be preſent at our Solemnities, God ſhall remove the Candleſtieks out of their Place. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt certain, that ſuch a one is now among us; let him not eſcape our Hands, leſt Reproach and Contempt come on Iſrael.</hi> But behold,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102963:144"/>whilſt they were buſy in ſearching for the Cauſe of this <hi>Prodigy,</hi> Two <hi>Angels</hi> conveyed <hi>Mahomet</hi> to <hi>Mecca,</hi> where he ſoon after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Chadijah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It were eaſy to recount many more <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> in the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>Prophet;</hi> ſuch as that of the Cloud Overſhadowing him, the Eagle perching on his Head when he was aſleep, the Trees and Stones proclaiming him the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> And, if we were to make <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels,</hi> I think, the Stupendous <hi>Deſcent</hi> which the <hi>Moon</hi> made, at the <hi>Prayer</hi> of the <hi>Divine Meſſenger;</hi> comes not far ſhort of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Diſorder on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> when your <hi>Law</hi> was delivered by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou requireſt Undoubted <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> for the Truth of this <hi>Miracle</hi> on <hi>Our</hi> Side, offer ſomething that is Unqueſtionable on thy <hi>Own.</hi> We both equally confide in the Different <hi>Records</hi> of our <hi>Nations,</hi> which were penn'd by Men as liable to Temptations and Errors of all Sorts, as thou and I, and all that believe what they write. Therefore, unleſs thou canſt ſtart ſome more Infallible <hi>Authority,</hi> to prove the Eternal and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Obligation of your <hi>Law,</hi> than I can to the Contrary, thou lieſt under a manifeſt Diſadvantage: Since I profeſs with our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> and all the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> that the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> contains Nothing Repugnant to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but is only a more Perfect and Complete <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Divine Will:</hi> And that as <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>Lawgiver</hi> of the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Iſaac;</hi> ſo <hi>Mahomet</hi> was the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the

                  <p>THere has been a mighty Quarrel of late between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> about <hi>Precedency.</hi> The Occaſion was this. One Evening the <hi>French Embaſſador</hi> was Riding in a Coach, in a Place where the <hi>Spaniſh Embaſſador</hi> met him in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Coach; and both ſtriving for the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Hand, they met with their Horſes Heads one againſt another, and ſo ſtood ſtill. There was preſently a Tumult of People gathered about them: And the <hi>French</hi> being moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, many Gentlemen came in to his Side with Swords and Piſtols; and all Things ſeemed to portend a Combat. But, the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> having Notice of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, ſent ſome of the <hi>Guards</hi> to keep the <hi>Peace,</hi> and defend the <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> from
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:102963:145"/>any Attempts of the Rabble. In the mean while, ſeveral <hi>Great Lords</hi> walked to and fro between the <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> propoſing Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of Accommodation: But it being at the very Juncture when the <hi>French Embaſſador</hi> had received the News of the Surrender of <hi>Montmedi,</hi> he wou'd not in the leaſt yield to any Terms. So that at laſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was forced to drive out of the Way, thinking it a Matter of ſufficient Triumph, That he had ſtopp'd the <hi>French Embaſſador</hi> ſo long.</p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>Poſt</hi> come in from <hi>Denmark,</hi> who brings News of the Total Deſtruction of <hi>Itzchow</hi> by Fire. This was a <hi>Town</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Danes,</hi> and was fir'd by the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Order. The <hi>Danes</hi> are very Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate of late Years; they make no Figure in <hi>Europe.</hi> There is a Period ſet to the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of every <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and the <hi>Danes</hi> were once very Victorious and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable; but now their <hi>Monarchy</hi> declines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, to make Way for the Riſing Luſtre of the <hi>Suedes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By Sea the <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> make a great Noiſe: They have lately taken from the <hi>French,</hi> Twenty <hi>Merchant</hi> Veſſels, and from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> near half that Number. But, if they have not better Fortune than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the <hi>French</hi> will take their City from them e'er long. Every Campagne makes a fair Advance toward it. I ſent an Account al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to the <hi>Kaimacham</hi> of the Surrender of <hi>Montmedi,</hi> one of the moſt Important Places in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Now I acquaint thee,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102963:146"/>that St. <hi>Venant,</hi> which has not ſo great a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, yet Conſiderable enough, has yielded upon <hi>Articles.</hi> This was done on the 28th. of the laſt <hi>Moon.</hi> At this Rate, the <hi>French Prieſts</hi> will have little elſe to do, but to ſing <hi>Te Deum,</hi> for their repeated Succeſſes and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Portugal</hi> we hear, that that <hi>Court</hi> to ſecure themſelves the better againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> have ſent to implore the Aſſiſtance of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez:</hi> Which is much cenſur'd among the <hi>Nazarenes.</hi> Others ſay, they are only Meſſengers, gone to buy up all the Horſes they can get in that <hi>Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is taking all the <hi>Politick</hi> Meaſures he can, for the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Weſt.</hi> His <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> appear with a Magnificent Train of Three Hundred Men, and they ſtyle their <hi>Maſter, His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, King of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Navarre, <hi>Sovereign Prince in</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <hi>and</hi> Italy; Which laſt, is look'd upon as a Fair Step to the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Emperour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Counſels</hi> of the <hi>German Court</hi> are not a little diſturb'd, to hear that our <hi>Invincible Forces</hi> are approaching toward the <hi>Confines</hi> of <hi>Hungary.</hi> It will put ſome Stop to the deſign'd <hi>Election.</hi> Beſides, they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree among themſelves about a <hi>Succeſſor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen Chriſtina</hi> of <hi>Sueden,</hi> is come back again into this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> being frighted out of <hi>Italy</hi> a Second <hi>Time,</hi> by the Return of the <hi>Plague.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a <hi>War</hi> commenc'd between the

                  <p>All this is of no ſuch Importance, as the News that I receive from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> which aſſures me, that the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> have retaken the <hi>Iſles</hi> of <hi>Tenedos</hi> and <hi>Lemnos,</hi> tho' with ſome Loſs of Men.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh they cou'd as eaſily drive the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> out of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and then the <hi>Imperial</hi> City would have no longer Reaſon to complain for Want of Bread.</p>

In thoſe Days, I remember it was Common in the Publick <hi>Coffee-Hans,</hi> for <hi>Muſſulmans, Greeks, Curds</hi> and <hi>Franks,</hi> or Men of any other <hi>Religion,</hi> to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and vent their Thoughts with Liberty: No Man being willing to be Stigmatiz'd with the Character of a <hi>Clown,</hi> for taking Offence at another's <hi>Faith,</hi> tho' different from his own.</p>
                  <p>It was then eſteem'd a Point of Gallantry, to favour the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of all <hi>Sects,</hi> and let 'em talk and act as they pleas'd, provided they Blaſphem'd not <hi>God,</hi> or his <hi>Prophets.</hi> And they themſelves wou'd have Condemn'd any of their own <hi>Party,</hi> who ſhou'd have been Guilty of ſuch an Immorality and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Religion</hi> of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans,</hi> and the General Sence of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>But why then is the ſame Liberty retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now, and that among <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> who are Intimate Friends? Is it not now as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for us to converſe with one another by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or any other Way, as it was then to enter into Dialogues with <hi>Infidels?</hi> I would not encourage or imitate the Bold and Prophane Efforts of their Wit, who deny the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> or utter <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> againſt his <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger:</hi> The whole <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> is an Irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Teſtimony of an <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent Nature:</hi> And the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is an Evident Proof, of the Sanctity and Indiſpenſible <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:102963:147"/>of Our <hi>Holy Lawgiver.</hi> But I hope 'tis no Crime, to enter into Speculations of Things liable to Controverſy. At leaſt I will venture to diſcloſe to thee my Thoughts, who art the moſt Agreeable of all my Friends. I tell thee, my dear <hi>Gnet,</hi> it appears to me Ridiculous and like the Quarrels of Children, for <hi>Moſelmans</hi> to wrangle about mere Trifles in <hi>Religion,</hi> and that the <hi>Reſign'd</hi> to <hi>God</hi> ſhou'd be Zealous for the <hi>Whimſies</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> One Party believes the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is <hi>Eternal,</hi> Another ſays 'tis <hi>Created.</hi> In my Opinion, they are both Abſurd Aſſertions. The <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe then it will follow, That there are more <hi>Eternals</hi> than <hi>One,</hi> which is a fair Step to <hi>Polytheiſm</hi> and <hi>Idolatry:</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> is only an Impropriety of Speech; For we do not uſually ſay of any <hi>Writing,</hi> That it is <hi>Created,</hi> but <hi>Pen'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I can eaſily believe the Manifold <hi>Deſcents</hi> of <hi>Gabriel</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> when he brought down the <hi>Hundred</hi> and <hi>Four Sheets</hi> of <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi> But whether <hi>Adam</hi> had only <hi>Ten</hi> of theſe <hi>Sheets;</hi> or <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Twenty,</hi> as ſome ſay: Or, whether his Son <hi>Seth,</hi> had but <hi>Twenty Nine</hi> of them; or <hi>Fifty,</hi> according to Others; is not Material, according to my <hi>Faith.</hi> It is Poſſible <hi>Edris</hi> had no more nor leſs than Thirty, and <hi>Abrahim</hi> our <hi>Father,</hi> juſt Ten of theſe <hi>Divine Manuſcripts.</hi> Of this we are ſure, That the <hi>Volume</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> was ſent to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Mighty <hi>Alcoran</hi> to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the <hi>Seal</hi> of the <hi>Prophets.</hi>

                  <p>It is as eaſy for me to believe the <hi>Celeſtial Pen</hi> with which all theſe <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> were written, to be of ſome <hi>Admirable Subſtance.</hi> But, why it ſhou'd be made of <hi>Pearls,</hi> rather than of <hi>Diamonds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or any other <hi>Jewels,</hi> I ſee no Reaſon; Or, that it ſhou'd be a Journey of <hi>Fifty Years,</hi> for the Swifreſt <hi>Horſe</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> to run from one End of it to the other. Yet if I have not <hi>Faith</hi> enough for theſe Things, I will not be Angry with thoſe that have. Let every Man enjoy his Phancy.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot be ſo Indifferent, when I hear Men tell me, That <hi>God</hi> has a <hi>Body</hi> like Ours, with Eyes, Ears, Noſe, Hands, Tongue, and all other Members and Organs of Life, Sence. Speech and Morion: That he is ſubject to Paſſions of Love, Hatred, Anger, Grief, and all the Affections that are Common to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. Yet thou knoweſt, there is a <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> who believe all this, and preach it to others with great Aſſurance. What is this, but to ſet up an <hi>Idol,</hi> in the Place of <hi>God?</hi> For, the <hi>Original</hi> of all <hi>Idolatry,</hi> was the Vain Preſumption of Men, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the <hi>Incomprehenſible Divinity,</hi> under ſome Common <hi>Viſible Figure</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Beaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we muſt aſſign a <hi>Body</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> it wou'd ſeem more Rational to adhere to their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among the <hi>Sephatim,</hi> who ſay, his <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>Infinite, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumſcrib'd,</hi> and beyond all <hi>Form.</hi> Neither is it of any Import, that the <hi>Weſtern Philoſophers</hi> aſſert, It is of the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of all <hi>Bodies</hi> to be <hi>Circumſcrib'd</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite:</hi>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:102963:148"/>Since, though this may be readily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed true of <hi>Particular Bodies,</hi> yet muſt it ever be deny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d of the <hi>Immenſe</hi> and <hi>

                  <p>O <hi>Dgnet,</hi> when I have ſaid all I can, 'tis nothing to the Purpoſe.

                  <p>I Receiv'd the <hi>Diſpatch</hi> coming from Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Hands, an <hi>Expreſs</hi> perfum'd with <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> full of Honourable Words, and exhibiting a Command worthy of an <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man General.</hi> May the <hi>Angel</hi> of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> conduct thee in all thy <hi>Expeditions,</hi> againſt <hi>Infidels, Rebels,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thy Conceptions of the <hi>Preſent State</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> are very proper and lively. Yet, in ſome Things, 'tis poſſible thou haſt been mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform'd. The Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> are Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when compar'd with the more Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <hi>Wars</hi> of the <hi>North.</hi> That <hi>Quarter,</hi> is at preſent the <hi>Theatre</hi> of the moſt Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Actions. Yet the Campagnes in <hi>Flanders</hi> this Year, have made ſome Noiſe in the World.</p>
                  <p>But, all the Diſcourſe at preſent is, of the Famous Siege and taking of <hi>Fredericks-Ode</hi> by the <hi>Suedes.</hi> This is a <hi>Fortreſs</hi> belonging to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and eſteem'd one of the ſtrongeſt in <hi>Europe.</hi> Yet it was taken by Storm: Wherein the <hi>Danes</hi> loſt Ninety Three Principal <hi>Officers,</hi> and about Three Thouſand Common Soldiers; Thirty Three Colours; Seventy Seven Great Guns of Iron and Braſs; Three Hundred and Eighty Two Barrels of Powder; Forty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Muſquet-Bullets; Six Hundred Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's; Three Thouſand Pikes, and Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:102963:150"/>Two Hundred Suits of Armour.</p>
                  <p>This Victory makes the <hi>Suedes</hi> appear Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to their Enemies; and they are look'd upon as the only Flouriſhing <hi>Nation</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> as <hi>France</hi> is in the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Yet, to ſhew that there's no Unmix'd Happineſs here <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> their Intereſt has been much leſſen'd, by the Deſertion of the <hi>Brandenburghers,</hi> who now ſeem to favour the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>King Caſimir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Monarch</hi> had an Interview lately with the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> at a Place call'd <hi>Broombergh;</hi> where they embrac'd one another, banquetted together, and buried all the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of <hi>Enmity</hi> in Generous <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potations:</hi> For, this is the Way of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Princes</hi> of <hi>Europe;</hi> Who live in ſo Cold a <hi>Climate,</hi> that Nothing leſs than a Debauch with Wine, can thaw their Frozen <hi>Souls,</hi> and melt 'em into an Obliging Humour.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> I perceive thou know'ſt the <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Oliver,</hi> the New <hi>Sovereign</hi> of that <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> Yet I can inform thee, that he begins to change his Temper. There are Perſons in his <hi>Court,</hi> who give Conſtant Intelligence to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of all his Secrets. And, as the Exil'd <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> cou'd not <hi>ſnuff</hi> a <hi>Candle</hi> in a <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> but that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper</hi> had Knowledge of it; ſo neither can <hi>Oliver</hi> have a <hi>Dream,</hi> but ſome ſpightful <hi>Mercury</hi> carrys the News into Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Countries.</hi> His Sleep is Interrupted with Fearful <hi>Viſions</hi> of <hi>Plots,</hi> and <hi>Treaſons</hi> againſt his Life; which makes him change his Bed, Five or Six Times a-Night. They ſay, he is
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102963:150"/>Metamorphos'd from a <hi>Hero,</hi> to a perfect <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi> And, this is not the Report of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who take Things upon Truſt; but tis the Sport of the <hi>French Grandees,</hi> who wiſh well to the <hi>Son</hi> of the late Murder'd <hi>Engliſh King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt be Irregular in my Method of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that I may oblige thee with <hi>Military</hi> Remarks. A more particular Account of the <hi>Storm</hi> of <hi>Fredericks Ode,</hi> is juſt come to my Hands, wherein we are aſſur'd, that it was taken at the Firſt Aſſault, which much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the Honour of <hi>General Wrangle;</hi> and that the <hi>Crown-Marſhal</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> with many <hi>Senators</hi> and <hi>Grandees,</hi> fell by the Edge of the Sword; And that Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Captives</hi> were driven yok'd in Couples like Beaſts, as an Augmentation of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour</hi>'s Triumph.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not be diſpleaſed at the little Coherence and Order of theſe <hi>Memoirs,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that it ſuits well enough with the Subject: For I write <hi>a la Campagne,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> ſay, and ſo am oblig'd to entertain thee with broken Detachments of News, from ſeveral <hi>Parts,</hi> as Occaſion offers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſtark Mad, for the Loſs of <hi>Mardike,</hi> which was taken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> in the 9th. <hi>Moon,</hi> and all the Garriſon ſent Priſoners to <hi>Calais.</hi> They ſwear, they will have this Important <hi>Place</hi> again, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt 'em.

                  </p>
                  <p>It will be of no great Importance for thee to know, that the Siege of <hi>Munſter</hi> is rais'd, and a <hi>Peace</hi> Concluded between that <hi>City</hi> and their <hi>Biſhop:</hi> Yet 'tis convenient, that this ſhou'd be related to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Divan,</hi> who are the Judges of all Human E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.

                  <p>Illuſtrious <hi>Aga,</hi> I have obey'd thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, in ſending thee an Abſtract of all the moſt Remarkable Tranſactions in <hi>Europe,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt Three or Four <hi>Moons.</hi> I wiſh, 'twere as agreeable to any of my Friends, to ſend me the News of our <hi>Armies</hi> and <hi>Navy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I am more oblig'd to Strangers and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> for the Intelligence I have of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Affairs, than to any of the <hi>True Believers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brave <hi>Commander,</hi> may <hi>God</hi> preſerve thee from the Common Vices of a Soldiers Life, and make thee as Renowned as <hi>Caſſim Hali,</hi> who was preſent in 25 pitch'd Battels, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd 48 Wounds, and yet lived to the 63d.

                  <p>Would'ſt thou know what the Meaning of this is? I'll tell thee in Brief; I'm in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy with my ſelf, whether I'd beſt to die or live.</p>
                  <p>Wonder not at the Expreſſion, as if 'twere in any Man's Power to make this Choice; ſince according to the <hi>Muſſulman Faith,</hi> we cannot haſten or retard the Moments decree'd by <hi>Fate.</hi> Aſſuredly, <hi>Predeſtination</hi> does not in the leaſt interfere with what is called Man's <hi>Free Will.</hi> Every the moſt <hi>Voluntary Action</hi> of our Lives, complys as exactly with the Appointment of <hi>Eternal Deſtiny,</hi> as the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Fall of a Tyle from a Houſe, or the more Regular and Conſtant Deſcent of Rain, Snow and Hail from the Clouds. And, for ought I know, we may as Properly call it the <hi>Free-Will</hi> of a <hi>River</hi> to run toward the <hi>Sea,</hi> as for a Man to purſue the Various Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of his own Reaſon or Appetite. For ſo a <hi>Fountain</hi> frequently divides it ſelf into many <hi>Streams</hi> before it falls into the <hi>Ocean,</hi> which is its, <hi>Center.</hi> And Man himſelf, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the boaſted <hi>Freedom</hi> of his <hi>Will,</hi> is
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102963:152"/>as much confin'd to act according to his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Prepoſſeſſions, Prejudices, Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Habits;</hi> as the different <hi>Rivulets</hi> iſſuing from the ſame <hi>Spring,</hi> are reſtrained each within the <hi>Banks</hi> of its Proper <hi>Channel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not to entertain thee with more <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories;</hi> both thou and I, and all Men, find our ſelves Violently carry'd away by certain Inclinations ſo forcible, as no Power of our <hi>Will</hi> is able to reſiſt: Sometimes our Love, Hate, Joy, Grief, and ſo the Reſt of Human Paſſions, are as <hi>Involuntary,</hi> as the Motions of our <hi>Pulſe.</hi> And tho' in the moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Actions of our Lives, we Generally form ſome Regular Deſign, as their Scope and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Yet we do many Things without Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as <hi>Muſicians</hi> are ſaid ſometimes to play Excellent <hi>Tunes,</hi> without ſo much as regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or thinking what they are about. By all which it is Evident, that our <hi>Will</hi> has lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to do in the Conduct of our Lives. We, like all other Creatures, act according to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Secret Impulſes</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> The very ſame <hi>Faculty</hi> which we call <hi>Inſtinct</hi> in the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> is no other than what we term <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Wiſdom, Knowledge, Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt</hi> in <hi>our ſelves.</hi> And I think 'tis no <hi>Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm</hi> to ſay, That that was a Prudent <hi>Dog,</hi> who perceiving his <hi>Maſter</hi> making ready a Rope to hang him, ſlily ſlipt away, and never came near him more.</p>
                  <p>Suffer me to make yet a farther Digreſſion, and aſcribe it to <hi>Fate.</hi> For I'm on a ſudden ſtrangely Interrupted in my Thoughts, by a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102963:153"/>moſt Furious <hi>Tempeſt;</hi> A Medley of Hail, Rain, Lightning and Thunder: And this laſt, tho' not over-noiſy and loud, yet it was the moſt ſingularly terrifying, that ever I heard in my Life. There is a Sort of <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> which they call the <hi>Drum,</hi> becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches near the Sound of that Warlike In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, making a Lively, Fierce Rumbling in the Air, like the Beat of an <hi>Alarm.</hi> There is another more ſurprizing, like the Roaring of <hi>Cannons.</hi> But this had a Touch in it, of the moſt Harſh, Affrighting and Irregular Noiſes, that ever ſhook the <hi>Welkin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was poſſeſſed with a deep Melancholy, as ſoon as I heard the Horrid Clatter begin, and ſaw the Air darken apace, with a more than Ordinary Gloomineſs. Then I felt ſome <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> Paſſions ſtruggling with my Reaſon. I was full of Fears, leſt <hi>God</hi> was Angry with me, for my Counterfeited Life among the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> And imagined no leſs, than that this <hi>Tempeſt</hi> was raiſed on Purpoſe to deſtroy me; and make me an Example to all <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans,</hi> who dare deny the <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> to ſerve the Intereſt of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> as much a Mortal as themſelves. Or, at leaſt, I concluded I ſhould taſte my Share of the Wrath of <hi>Heaven,</hi> at this Cholerick Juncture. Nay, and all the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> I could muſter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſerved but to raiſe my diſmal Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of the <hi>Fatal Blaſt.</hi> For I could not avoid thinking, That a <hi>Wicked Man</hi> is a <hi>Magnet,</hi> which <hi>Naturally</hi> attracts the <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> of <hi>Heaven:</hi> And that I being ſuch in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:102963:153"/>the Higheſt Degree, could not fail of having my <hi>Soul</hi> ſcorched up at Once to <hi>Nothing,</hi> or <hi>Metamorphoſed</hi> to a <hi>Fury</hi> (which is Worſe) by ſome Surprizing and Inevitable <hi>Flaſh.</hi> For, to paſs from this <hi>Life</hi> by Light'ning, Poyſon, or an Earthquake, are the only Deaths I fear.</p>
                  <p>I fell on my Knees and Face, addreſſing my ſelf to <hi>God,</hi> with the moſt Humble and Fervent <hi>Devotion</hi> I was Capable of. I made my Application alſo to his <hi>Prophets.</hi> I ſaid and did, all that I thought would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Reſpite of the Puniſhment I fear'd. At length being tyred and ſick of too much <hi>Prayer,</hi> I roſe and ſate down chearfully; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring I was a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> and reſigned to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny.</hi> Conſidering alſo, that I was an <hi>Arabian,</hi> of a <hi>Noble Stock;</hi> I reſolv'd, if I muſt die, to prepare my ſelf with a Moderation worthy of my <hi>Blood;</hi> that ſo I might go to the <hi>Inviſibles,</hi> like the <hi>Grand-Son</hi> of an <hi>Emir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Perhaps thou wilt impute this to Vanity: But I eſteem it a Point of Juſtice, for a Man to take Care, that he may live and die like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without degenerating from the <hi>Virtue</hi> of his <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> or bringing a Diſgrace on the <hi>Tribe</hi> to which he belongs. For, tho' <hi>God</hi> has Created all Men of the ſame <hi>Mould,</hi> yet he has diſtinguiſh'd One <hi>Family</hi> from Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by more than <hi>Specifick Characters</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on them in their <hi>Nativity:</hi> And has Ennobled ſome Mortals with Peculiar Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:102963:154"/>and Innate Perfections, which Others are wholly Strangers to. So, there are Others Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for <hi>Hereditary</hi> Vices.</p>
                  <p>Whether theſe Things depend on the <hi>Blood,</hi> or on the Different Circumſtances of <hi>Souls</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came into theſe Bodies, is a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not ſoon reſolv'd. But, this I'm ſure of, That I find in my ſelf both ſome Virtues and Vices, which I could never yet diſcover ſo Odly blended together in any other Mortal. I'm always Campagning on the <hi>Frontiers</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> Yet my Paſſions are not Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary: No Price can tempt me to Treaſon or Perfidy. I am Maſter of a certain Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, which no Human Charm is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſmantle. My Integrity cannot be warp'd by Gold. And 'tis for this Reaſon, I a little value my ſelf. Which makes me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inclin'd rather bravely to ſally forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown</hi> World, than tarry in <hi>This,</hi> where I meet with Nothing but Contempt and Diſeſteem from the <hi>Slaves</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> for whoſe Sake I bear the Fatigue of Life. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, think I, wherever it be my Lot to go, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Eſcape from this <hi>Mortal State;</hi> the <hi>Spirits</hi> of that <hi>Region</hi> will be kind to me, for the Sake of my Incorruptible Truſtineſs: For, they have Intrigues as well as we; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, will be glad of Faithful <hi>Agents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a Word, ſince all my Zeal and Loyalty is thought not to merit any Reward in this Life; I would fain try, whether at leaſt I may not deſerve to be a <hi>Ghoſt</hi> of <hi>Honour;</hi> If there
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:102963:154"/>be any ſuch Diſtinctions in that <hi>World</hi> of <hi>Spirits.</hi>

                     </gap>d of it by her Expreſs Order, and had a <hi>Confeſſour</hi> ſent to him, to prepare him for <hi>Another World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When this was done, ſhe immediately ſent a Meſſenger to acquaint the <hi>French King</hi> with this Action, and the Reaſons which induc'd her to it. Some of the <hi>Courtiers</hi> at firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him, That the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Proceeding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd

                  <p>The ſwift Execution of this <hi>Queen</hi>'s <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> on her Servant, in Part reſembles the Rigor of our <hi>Eaſtern Juſtice,</hi> which admits of no Delays in puniſhing <hi>Criminal</hi> Perſons, and removing <hi>Traytors</hi> out of the Way.

                  <p>THE <hi>Spaniards</hi> are all diſſolv'd in Joy for the Birth of a Young <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Heir</hi> of that declining <hi>Monarchy.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, that the <hi>King</hi> his Father, appointed a Solemn <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival</hi> throughout all his <hi>Dominions,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his <hi>Subjects</hi> to Celebrate it with the moſt Exalted Demonſtrations of Joy.

In a Word, her Manner of Living, is a fit Example for the <hi>French</hi> Women: For, in all Things ſhe obſerves the <hi>Laws</hi> of her <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the Modeſt <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi>

                  <p>No Argument can perſuade her to change her <hi>Grecian</hi> Garb, or dreſs her ſelf after the Looſe Mode of <hi>Weſtern</hi> Females. Neither Will ſhe Eat or Drink any where, but in the Houſe of <hi>Eliachim,</hi> for Fear of infringing the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and diſobeying the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> For ſhe eſteems the <hi>Diet</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> Pure, and free from <hi>Pollution.</hi> In her Pious and Motherly Zeal, ſhe rebukes me for Eating and Drinking with <hi>Infidels:</hi> And I've Nothing to ſay in my Defence, but the Neceſſity I lie under of preventing Suſpicion, that ſo I may ſerve the <hi>Sultan</hi> with greater Succeſs, and that I have the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s <hi>Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> for this and many more Irregularities.

'Tis poſſible, the Change of Air, with the Inconveniences of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo far by Sea and Land, might incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode her at Firſt.

                  <p>There are Three of theſe <hi>Admirable Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> not far from <hi>Caire,</hi> and about Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen more in the <hi>Deſerts</hi> of <hi>Libya.</hi> It is Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuppos'd, That they were built for <hi>Sepulchres</hi> of the <hi>Egyptian Kings;</hi> ſome of them before the <hi>Flood,</hi> the reſt after. There are not wanting <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> who aſſert the Greateſt of the <hi>Pyramids</hi> to be the <hi>Tomb</hi> of <hi>Seth,</hi> the Son of <hi>Adam.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſouf</hi> was within this <hi>Mighty Fabrick,</hi> and atteſts, That after he and his Company had deſcended and aſcended through certain <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,</hi> they came at laſt to a <hi>Square Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> wall'd about with Pure <hi>Thebaick Marble;</hi> in the Middle of which was a Cheſt of the ſame Stone, which when ſtruck with the Foot, ſounded like a <hi>Muſical Inſtrument.</hi> It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that in this Cheſt was laid the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> who built that <hi>Pyramid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> were of Opinion, That even after that which we call <hi>Death,</hi>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:102963:159"/>or the <hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> there were certain <hi>Arts</hi> to retain 'em together; if not in ſo Strict and Intimate an Union as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet in a very Familiar Correſpondence for many Ages. So that the <hi>Soul</hi> ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways take Delight to hover about the <hi>Body.</hi> and to exerciſe its <hi>Faculties</hi> in the Place where that was repoſed.</p>
                  <p>For this Reaſon, in the Firſt Place they took out the Bowels, and whatſoever was moſt liable to <hi>Corruption:</hi> And having waſh'd the Empty Belly with <hi>Wine</hi> of <hi>Palms,</hi> mix'd with <hi>Aromatick</hi> Powders, they ſtuffed it with <hi>Myrrh, Caſſia,</hi> and many Coſtly <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;</hi> and then ſow'd it up. After this, they purified the Whole <hi>Body</hi> with <hi>Nitre;</hi> And having drawn out the Brains by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils with a Hook, they fill'd up the Skull with Melted Gums. And laſt of all, they ſwathed up the Whole Body in Silk, ſmearing it over with Rich Mixtures of <hi>Bitumen, Spices</hi> and <hi>Gums,</hi> and ſo delivered it to the Kindred to be laid up in the <hi>Sepulchre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe were the Preparations they made to Court the Preſence of the <hi>Soul,</hi> by rendring the <hi>Body</hi> for Ever Sweet and Incorruptible. And, that the Majeſty of <hi>Royal Ghoſts</hi> might never be Interrupted or Violated by the Neighbourhood of <hi>Vulgar Spirits,</hi> or the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Approach of Mortals; <hi>Kings</hi> built theſe <hi>Magnificent Piles,</hi> as the <hi>Palaces</hi> of their <hi>Laſt Repoſe.</hi> 'Tis therefore they were Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Deſert and Unfrequented Places, and in ſuch a Form as was eſteemed the moſt
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:102963:160"/>Durable, and ſecure from the Injuries of <hi>Time,</hi> the Aſſaults of the <hi>Elements,</hi> and from the Common Fate of all Human Enterpriſes. Each Stone of a Prodigious Bulk, and rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the next with a Bar of Iron: Which with the Strength and Invincible Faſtneſs of the Cement, renders it a Thing Impoſſible for any one of theſe <hi>Pyramids</hi> to be demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho' all Mankind were ſet to work for many Succeſſive Generations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Al Mamun,</hi> the <hi>Caliph</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to do it, but in vain. For after he had ſet his Men at Work, and been at Vaſt Expences, they made but one ſmall Breach, ſo Inconſiderable, that being made Senſible it would exhauſt his <hi>Treaſures</hi> to remove but the Hundredth Part of the <hi>Pyramid,</hi> he deſiſted, full of Wonder at the Wiſdom of the <hi>Founders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be true, that the <hi>Soul</hi> may by ſuch Allurements as theſe, be prevailed on to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with the <hi>Body</hi> in its <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> and that a Man's Future Happineſs conſiſts in this, I ſhould my ſelf Admire and Imirate thoſe <hi>Egyptian Sages.</hi> I would in my Life-Time build me a ſmall <hi>Mauſoleum,</hi> according to my Ability, and order in my <hi>Laſt Will</hi> and <hi>Teſtament,</hi> that my <hi>Body</hi> be Embalmed and Condited for a Perpetual Duration. But if none of theſe <hi>Arts</hi> can alter the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> or force an <hi>Immortal Spirit</hi> from Ranging where it pleaſes; I muſt conclude with <hi>Pliny,</hi> That this Celebrated Wiſdom of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> was no other than Glorious
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:102963:160"/>Folly, and all the Magnificence of their <hi>Kings</hi> in building ſuch Coſtly <hi>Sepulchres,</hi> but <hi>Royal</hi> Waſte.</p>
                  <p>They themſelves, in thus cautiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding to ſecure the <hi>Soul</hi>'s Abode with the <hi>Body</hi> after <hi>Death,</hi> tacitely own'd, That by the Courſe of <hi>Nature</hi> it would immediately paſs into ſome other. Nay, the <hi>Tranſmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> was an Eſtabliſhed <hi>Doctrine</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> How then could they be ſo blind as to imagine a <hi>Dead Carcaſe,</hi> however Perfum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Fenced againſt <hi>Corruption,</hi> was more inviting than an <hi>Embryo</hi> formed to live? Or that it was more Elegible for the <hi>Soul</hi> to be Impriſoned in a <hi>Dark Dungeon</hi> (for no better are the Inſides of the <hi>Pyramids</hi>) than to enjoy the Light of the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> and the Various Sweets of the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi> Brother, in my Opinion, 'twere bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a Bird, a Worm, a Fly, or any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thing, than to be thus Immur'd for many Ages, and have no other Companion, but an Old Salted <hi>Mummie.</hi>

                     <hi>Iſouf</hi> has made ſome Remarks on the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nile,</hi> to which he ſays <hi>Egypt</hi> owes not only its Corn and Fruits, but alſo the very Soil which brings 'em forth. For every Year, at the Time of the Inundation, that River brings along with it from <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Regions</hi> through which it paſſes, Abundance of Slime and Mud, with which it covers all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> leaving it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind at the Decreaſe of the Waters; So that the Soil of <hi>Egypt</hi> is borrowed from other
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:102963:161"/>
                     <hi>Countries.</hi> And if this be true, for ought we know, the Place of its Situation may be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the Sea, according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome Ancient <hi>Philoſophers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herodotus, Pliny</hi> and others, were of this Perſuaſion, grounding their Conjectures on the nearer Approaches of the <hi>Continent</hi> to the <hi>Iſland Pharos,</hi> from the Time of <hi>Homer,</hi> who exactly Calculated its Diſtance. And they concluded, That the Immenſe Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Slime which the <hi>Nile</hi> tranſports from the Mountainous <hi>Regions</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> might in the Space of Two <hi>Myriads</hi> of Years, have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up all that Part of the Sea which is now <hi>Firm Land,</hi> and call'd <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Nazarenes</hi> have a bad Cauſe, and therefore are compelled to make Uſe of Shifts and Equivocations to ſupport it.

                  <p>It is believ'd in theſe <hi>Parts,</hi> That when the <hi>Venetians</hi> quitted the <hi>Iſland</hi> they departed not without Revenge, ſetting Fire to a Mine, and blowing up ſeveral Hundreds of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> into the Air.</p>

                  <p>Perhaps, their Caſe may be like that of <hi>Nadaſt, Governour</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi> when <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Magnificent</hi> beſieged that City.

                  <p>The <hi>Imperial</hi> City is full of ſuch, both Natives and Strangers. Cull them out from the mix'd Multitude, and make 'em thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, without regarding the Difference of <hi>Religion,</hi> whether they be <hi>Muſſulmans, Franks, Armenians, Jews,</hi> or others. Above all Things, ſhun the Society of <hi>Bigots,</hi> and number not thy ſelf among thoſe who are Opinionated, becauſe they profeſs the <hi>True Faith:</hi> For, what ſignifies that, if their Lives be Vitious? I tell thee, they are worſe than the <hi>Infidels.</hi> Give no Heed to <hi>Fortune-Tellers,</hi> and ſuch as pretend to <hi>Aſtrology.</hi> For whilſt they boaſt of knowing other Mens Fates, they are Ignorant of their own. And if there be any Truth in that <hi>Science,</hi> one may ſay, their Ignorance in it affronts the <hi>Stars,</hi> and often provokes 'em to haſten their own Ruine.

Neither cou'd all the <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> of <hi>Old,</hi> the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Sages,</hi> for ought I perceive, agree in their Verdict about this <hi>Myſterious</hi> Thing which we all the <hi>Soul.</hi>

                  <p>But there were Men of Sublime Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who affirm'd the <hi>Soul</hi> to be, <hi>A Divine Subſtance, Independent of the Body.</hi> Of this Opinion were <hi>Zoroaſter, Hermes Triſmegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Plutarch, Porphyry,</hi> and <hi>Plato.</hi> This laſt defin'd the <hi>Soul</hi> to be, <hi>A Self-Moving Eſſence, endu'd with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> But when they have ſaid all, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Modeſty of <hi>Cicero, Seneca,</hi> and others, who acknowledg'd they were altogether Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what the <hi>Soul.</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>There was no leſs Diſagreement among the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> about the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Soul.

                  <p>NOW the <hi>Scenes</hi> are changed in <hi>Europe.</hi> Enemies are become Friends, and thoſe who profeſſed a Mutual Friendſhip, are at open Defiance. Conſtancy is a Vice in the <hi>Politicks,</hi> and a Dextrous Way of ſhifting from one Engagement to another; for Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, is eſteemed the only <hi>State</hi>-Vertue.</p>
                  <p>I have already Intimated to the <hi>Divan,</hi> the <hi>War</hi> which broke out laſt Year between the <hi>Suedes</hi> and <hi>Danes.</hi> The latter begun it by Solemn <hi>Proclamation,</hi> ſending a <hi>Herald</hi> at <hi>Arms</hi> to the <hi>Suediſh Court,</hi> and diſpatching <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> to all his <hi>Allies</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> to give them an Account of his Proceedings. Now I ſhall entertain thee with a ſhort <hi>Idea</hi> of this <hi>War.</hi> By which thou wilt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, That the <hi>Danes</hi> are either much dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the Valour of their <hi>Anceſtors,</hi>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:102963:166"/>who formerly made the moſt terrible Figure of all the <hi>Nations</hi> in the <hi>North:</hi> Or elſe, they are leſs obliged to <hi>Fortune,</hi> who has not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them with ſo many Succeſſes and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of late, but rather expoſed 'em to the Inſults of their Enemies, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all Men.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> firſt proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this <hi>War,</hi> he had a fair Advantage of the <hi>Suedes,</hi> who at that Time were ſorely entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled between the <hi>Polanders, Germans</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> and had more Need of Helps than Hind'rances. Yet, <hi>King Guſtavus</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Part of his Forces into <hi>Holſtein, Schone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Juitland,</hi> he took one Part after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, till he had over-run thoſe <hi>Provinces</hi> in the Space of Six <hi>Moons;</hi> And reduced the <hi>Danes</hi> to a Neceſſity of Compoſition, and that on ſuch Diſhonourable Terms, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them the Scorn of the Neighbouring <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the 13th. of the 3d. <hi>Moon,</hi> the Two <hi>Kings</hi> had an Interview near <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> the <hi>Capital</hi> City of <hi>Denmark:</hi> For, ſo far had the Fortune of the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Arms carried their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories. They Eat and Drank together ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times, and Converſed privately ſome Hours. At laſt, a Firm <hi>Peace</hi> was Concluded between them, and they concerted the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a Perfect Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>But, before this, the <hi>Dane</hi> had been forced to yield up <hi>Schoneland,</hi> with <hi>Elſimberg,</hi> which commands Half the <hi>Baltick Sea.</hi> He
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102963:167"/>ſurrendred alſo the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Blakin</hi> and <hi>Halland,</hi> with a very ſtrong Caſtle; the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Burtholme;</hi> Ten <hi>Ships</hi> of <hi>War;</hi> and obliged himſelf to pay a Million of <hi>Dollars;</hi> and to maintain Four Thouſand Horſe and Foot in the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Suedeland</hi>'s Service, and give Free Quarter to all the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Forces till the 5th. <hi>Moon.</hi> Theſe are ſuch Diſhonourable <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> has quite loſt himſelf in the Eſteem of all his <hi>Allies.</hi> They call him a Poor-Spirited <hi>Prince,</hi> not Worthy of Support or Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>In a Word, Serene <hi>Baſſa,</hi> it is like to fare with him, as with other Unfortunate Men, who when they are once falling, every Body will help to throw them down. Therefore conſerve thy Honours, as the only Bulwark of thy Intereſt and Life.</p>

                  <p>My <hi>Soul</hi> has been very Inquiſitive and Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for many Years, and I think this is owing to my <hi>Captivity</hi> in <hi>Palermo.</hi> For before that, whilſt I lived at Eaſe in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> basking under the Warmer <hi>Influence</hi> of <hi>Royal Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> the Sacred Preſence of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who like the <hi>Sun</hi> gives Motion, Heat and Life to all things; I ne'er regarded <hi>Books,</hi> or once applied my Mind to ſtudy any Thing, but how to acquit my ſelf in my <hi>Station,</hi> and ſtrengthen my Intereſt at the <hi>Court:</hi> Eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all other <hi>Learning</hi> as <hi>Barbarous,</hi> which conduced not to this End.</p>
                  <p>Foreign <hi>Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Contemptible to me: I thought it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a <hi>Muſſulman Courtier,</hi> to give his Tongue and Mind the Fatigue of any other <hi>Dialect,</hi> ſave the <hi>Perſian, Arabick,</hi> and <hi>Turkiſh:</hi> Or to load his Memory with the <hi>Records</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nations,</hi> deſigned to be the <hi>Slaves</hi> of <hi>True Believers.</hi>

                  <p>As to the <hi>Speculative Sciences,</hi> I was Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſirous enough of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> But I either had not Leiſure, or wanted <hi>Books</hi> and other Advantages of <hi>Study.</hi> So that all the

                  <p>'Tis true indeed, by Converſing frequently with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> I ſoon learned their <hi>Vulgar Dialect;</hi> But this is far from the Polite <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Grecians:</hi> And a <hi>Page</hi> of the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> taught me the Rudiments of <hi>Sclavonian;</hi> which afterwards I learn'd more Perfectly, hoping it would be of ſome Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to me one Time or other.</p>
                  <p>All theſe were very Superficial Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet I thought my ſelf Happy enough, without ſearching any farther.

                  <p>I grew very Contemplative: And having acquainted my ſelf with an honeſt <hi>Carpenter</hi> in the <hi>Town</hi> where we lived, who had a great many <hi>Books</hi> in's Cuſtody, he lent me ſeveral Choice <hi>Treatiſes;</hi> and I borrowed all the Hours I could from Sleep, to peruſe them with Attention and Profit.

                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Murat, Baſſa.</head>
                  <p>THere has been ſomething lately tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> which ſeems a <hi>Myſtery.</hi> No body here underſtands the Meaning of it, but the very <hi>Privado's</hi> of the <hi>Cabinet:</hi> Yet every one gueſſes, 'tis a Fetch of <hi>Mazarini</hi>'s Wit. That <hi>Miniſter</hi> has more <hi>Meanders</hi> in his Brains, than an Old <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gameſter at <hi>Cheſs;</hi> who foreſees no leſs than <hi>Nine</hi> Unavoidable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, before he makes <hi>One</hi> bold Motion: And, to be ſure, the laſt ſhall be to his own Advantage. In a Word, <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt Important <hi>Sea-Town</hi> of all the <hi>Weſt,</hi> is ſurrendered by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the <hi>French;</hi> and by theſe, as an Earneſt of Friendſhip, is put into the Hands of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The little <hi>Politicians</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> are amaz'd at it; and the Greateſt <hi>Machiavils</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> either cannot, or will not inform 'em of the True Secret.</p>
                  <p>You ſhall ſee Two or Three Grave <hi>Citizens,</hi> brooding Thoughts together over a <hi>Box</hi> of <hi>Polvita,</hi> and ſneezing out their Sentiments, without Reſerve. Yet after all their Wiſe Conſult, they part as great Fools as they met, and only ſatisfy themſelves, with Nodding
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:102963:173"/>Wiſdom to each other, at the laſt <hi>Congè;</hi> wherein is comprehended, the Whole <hi>Syſtem</hi> of the <hi>Politicks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was generally thought to be ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Overture this <hi>Court</hi> would make to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when a little before the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Crequi, Firſt Gentleman</hi> of the <hi>Bed-Chamber,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Mancini,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Nephew, were ſent with a Splendid <hi>Retinue</hi> of <hi>French Nobles</hi> to <hi>England.</hi> Every Body gueſs'd, ſome Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Action would follow; and that it muſt needs be a <hi>Myſtery</hi> of Grand Importance, which could not be truſted to Perſons of leſs Note than the Two Chief <hi>Favourites</hi> of the <hi>Cardinal Miniſter.</hi> And now 'tis come out, they know not what to make on't, Neither can I poſſibly learn as yet, the true Reaſon of putting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Poſſeſſion of ſuch a <hi>Town</hi> as this, which commands all the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Seas, and has coſt ſo much Sweat and Blood to take from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> I have ſet <hi>Oſmin</hi> the <hi>Dwarf</hi> to Work, and laid Traps to get the Secret from ſeveral other <hi>Courtiers.</hi> But, I might as well have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to find out the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which caus'd a Quarrel between <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> Time perhaps will diſcover the Secret. And I dare at preſent conclude, that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> are the only <hi>Nation</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> whoſe Friendſhip the <hi>French</hi> think worth Courting.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> has been very Ill of a <hi>Fever,</hi> and in great Danger of his Life: But is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered again; which occaſions Abundance
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:102963:174"/>of Real Joy among his Friends and Loyal <hi>Subjects.</hi> As for the Reſt, they know how to counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>I had almoſt forgot to tell thee, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> endeavouring to relieve <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> were encountered by the <hi>French,</hi> and Routed: About Two Thouſand of their Men being killed, and as many taken Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sage Baſſa,</hi> the Succeſſes of this <hi>Monarch</hi> are ſo Conſtant, that they have given Birth to a <hi>Proverb:</hi> For when they would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage any Man's Hopes, or make a ſtrong Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveration, they uſually ſay, <hi>As ſure as the</hi> Great Lewis <hi>will get a Town or Two in</hi> Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>this Campagne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> is a Brave <hi>General,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Victories are in a great Meaſure owing to his Conduct. He is very Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in his Undertakings. There were but a few Days between the Surrender of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and his taking of <hi>Bergen, Furnes</hi> and <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mude;</hi> Three ſtrong <hi>Fortreſſes</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi> And, 'tis thought, 'twill not be long before he takes others.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French King,</hi> is in a Fair Way to the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Weſt.</hi> But this will not be for the Intereſt of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> For, then he will have a New Enemy, of an Old Friend, and one more Potent than he had before. Yet, <hi>Deſtiny</hi> over-rules All Things.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Mahammed, <hi>the</hi> Eremit <hi>of</hi> Mount Uriel <hi>in</hi> Arabia.</head>
                  <p>I Have often troubl'd thee with Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Addreſſes, O Matchleſs Mortal; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me once more to unboſom my Thoughts, as to my <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> or rather as to an <hi>Oracle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, this Hour the <hi>Stars</hi> of my <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> ſuffer a Mighty Change. I ſeem to my ſelf, like one newly awak'd out of a deep Sleep, or from the Deluſions of a long <hi>Dream:</hi> For, ſo methinks, have my Paſt Years gone away like a <hi>Night,</hi> wherein my Labouring Spirit has encounter'd with No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Phantaſms, Viſions</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My <hi>Infant</hi> Days I eſteem the moſt Happy, when my Ignorance of Vice had greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on my Actions, and preſerv'd me more free from Blemiſh, than cou'd afterwards all my Acquir'd Knowledge of the <hi>Precepts</hi> and <hi>Maxims</hi> of <hi>Vertue.</hi> For no ſooner was I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join'd the Study of <hi>Morality,</hi> and taught to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> but my Curioſity prompted me to examine the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Latter,</hi> more cloſely than by bare Speculation. I found my ſelf more Forcibly carry'd away by a Secret Pleaſure, to make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of what was <hi>Forbidden,</hi> than to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe what was <hi>Commanded:</hi> So prone is Man
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:102963:175"/>to be jealous of his <hi>Tutors,</hi> and to ſuſpect thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> as <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> which put a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi> on his <hi>Native Liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides this, there are certain Genial Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in every Mortal, which the <hi>Youngeſt,</hi> and he that is in his <hi>Nonage,</hi> thinks he has as much right to gratify, as the <hi>Wiſeſt Senior.</hi> Nor can any Reaſon eaſily perſuade him to part with this Privilege, but under the Notion of being highly wrong'd; ſince every Man Naturally places his Intereſt and Happineſs, in purſuing the Motions of his own Will.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, I never was prone to any Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Vices,</hi> or ſuch as for their Singularity, wou'd make the moſt harden'd <hi>Libertine</hi> bluſh, did he practiſe them to the Knowledge of Men.</p>
                  <p>I ever had an Unconquerable Abhorrence for thoſe Specifick Acts of Laſciviouſneſs, which ought not to be nam'd, and whoſe very <hi>Idea</hi> makes the Thought recoil: Yet am Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Amorous, and cannot but pay to Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Sentiments and Paſſions which are due from <hi>Platonick</hi> Love. I admire Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Elegance, where-ever I diſcern them; and can ſtand gazing whole Hours together, on a <hi>Flower,</hi> a <hi>Tree,</hi> or a <hi>Peacock.</hi> I am En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour'd with the Brightneſs of the <hi>Sun;</hi> and like another <hi>Endymion,</hi> I languiſh for a more Intimate Acquaintance with the <hi>Moon.</hi> The Leſſer Beauties of the Night, the <hi>Stars,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame me with a Thouſand Paſſions. I make my Court to the Whole <hi>Hoaſt</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> yet I hope commit no <hi>Idolatry.</hi> In fine, I am
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:102963:175"/>in Love with the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe;</hi> and die hourly, when I contemplate the Glory of that <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Eſſence,</hi> which is the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Source</hi> of <hi>All Things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are Paſſions not unbecoming a <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman.</hi> But I have alſo ſome Emotions for Beautiful Women, more Violent than all the Reſt, more Dangerous and Fatal. Tell me, O Pious <hi>Sylvan,</hi> how I ſhall gratify my Love, without offending Virtue, or the Gravity of a Man?</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Creatures</hi> ſeem to be Created for our Perplexity; ſince a Man can neither well be Happy with, or without 'em. They are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Riddles:</hi> And to love 'em, or hate 'em too much, is an Equal <hi>Soleciſm.</hi> 'Twere a Queſtion worthy of a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> Whether this <hi>Sex,</hi> among all the Neceſſary Good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they do us, were not ſent into the World as <hi>Spies</hi> and <hi>Trepans,</hi> to obſerve our Counſels and Actions: And by mixing Smiles with Frowns, Flatteries with Reproaches, Sullenneſs with more Obliging Favours; to keep us in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Maze</hi> and <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> leſt the Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Wit of Men ſhou'd, if left to themſelves, attempt ſomething more Audacious than the <hi>Poets</hi> feign of the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Titan,</hi> or the <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law</hi> Records of <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who built the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Babel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, whether they be <hi>Spies,</hi> or <hi>Faithful Aſſiſtants, Enemies</hi> or <hi>Friends,</hi> I tell thee plainly, I have not been able to forbear Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 'em exceſſively. And this is Part of the <hi>Dream</hi> or <hi>Trance,</hi> out of which I am juſt now Awak'd.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:102963:176"/>
                  <p>Another <hi>Scene,</hi> is that of <hi>Honour.</hi> This is a Phantome alſo, a mere Vapour, a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. I never hunted after Glory, nor court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Popular Applauſe. Yet being entruſted with the <hi>Sublime Secrets,</hi> and commanded to ſerve the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in this <hi>Station,</hi> I wou'd fain acquit my ſelf without Diſgrace. Nay, like other Mortals in ſuch a <hi>Poſt,</hi> I wou'd willingly have the Smiles of my <hi>Sovereign,</hi> and the Careſſes of the <hi>Happy Miniſters</hi> who ſerve <hi>him,</hi> if it ſhall be my Lot ever to return to the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Nothing appears to me more Terrible, than at ſuch a Time to encounter with Rugged, Furrow'd Viſages, or Cold and Faint Embraces of my <hi>Fellow-Slaves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This puts me upon a Thouſand Inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; makes me ſwear to Contradictions; utter Lyes and Blaſphemies, which would turn the <hi>Devil</hi> to a <hi>Saint</hi> for Fear. In a Word, I ſtumble at no Vice or Immorality, which may promote the <hi>Cauſe</hi> I am engag'd in. And all this for the Sake of a Fair Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter at the <hi>Port:</hi> Whilſt I'm cajoling my ſelf as well as others with a Perſuaſion, that 'tis only on the Score of Honeſty, and to acquit my ſelf a Good Man. Thus, I purſue a Blaſt, a Bubble, the <hi>Idea</hi> of Nothing, mere Vanity and an Empty <hi>Dream.</hi> And 'tis harder for me to ſhake off this <hi>Enchantment,</hi> than that of <hi>Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, all this while, I have not taken the <hi>French</hi> Method to gain <hi>Honour.</hi> I never was Guilty of Oppreſſion and Cruelty, nor bath'd my Hands in Human Blood. No <hi>Widow</hi> or
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:102963:176"/>
                     <hi>Orphan</hi> mourns for what I've taken from 'em. Nor did I ever Dragoon any Body into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with Reaſon. All the Parts I've Acted in this Nature, were Defenſive; Pure Efforts of <hi>Self-Preſervation:</hi> Which, thou know'ſt, is a <hi>Principle</hi> Natural to all Men, and even to the <hi>Worms</hi> of the Earth. Theſe Little <hi>Reptiles,</hi> when they're trampl'd on, will turn again. And nothing more do I, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>This puts me in Mind of my <hi>Integrity:</hi> For, I muſt tell thee my Virtues as well as my Vices. Neither <hi>Arabia,</hi> nor all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> have ever brought forth a Man more true to his Truſt, than Honeſt Loyal <hi>Mahmut.</hi> I will for ever boaſt of this, in an Age ſo full of Treachery. This alone will carry me ſafe to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> in Spight of all the <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lahs.</hi> As for the Reſt, they're only <hi>Venial</hi> Sins, eaſily dropt off on the Bridge of Tryal. And ſo long as no Body can ſay, I've betray'd my <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Secrets, I'm ſafe as an <hi>Angel</hi> that is not oblig'd to ſtand <hi>Sentinel</hi> at the Loweſt Poſt of <hi>Heaven:</hi> For, there he's within Gun-ſhot of the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Juſt as I drew my Pen from that Word, a ſuddain Noiſe in the Streets call'd me to the Window. Where turning my Eyes from the Earth to the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> (for 'twas a very ſerene Sky) I obſerv'd a ſmall ſwift Cloud to glide along from <hi>South</hi> to <hi>North,</hi> much in Appearance like a <hi>Bale</hi> of <hi>Silk.</hi> It cleft the <hi>Element</hi> like a Sly <hi>Arab Thief,</hi> that ſwims for Booty on the River <hi>Tigris.</hi> Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:102963:177"/>at this, when all the <hi>Firmament</hi> was Clear, and not another Cloud above the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon;</hi> I ſoon concluded, 'Twas the <hi>Chariot</hi> of ſome <hi>Airy God,</hi> a <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> ſent with ſpeedy News, to the <hi>High Lords, Commanders</hi> of the <hi>Artick Regions;</hi> to bid 'em be upon their Guard, or ſome ſuch weighty Matter. Perhaps, thought I, a <hi>War</hi> is commenc'd between the <hi>Spirits</hi> of the <hi>Poles.</hi> Or, it may be, King <hi>Aeolus</hi> has ſent a <hi>Summons</hi> to the <hi>Northern</hi> Winds, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to play ſome Royal Pneumatick Freaks upon the Sea.</p>
                  <p>In good Earneſt, it made me reflect on our Ignorance of the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the <hi>Elements.</hi> It put me in Mind of the Fogs and Miſts, which ſometimes envelop the <hi>Globe</hi> in Darkneſs; on Purpoſe, for ought we know, to hinder us from ſeeing what is tranſacting at ſuch Seaſons in the <hi>Higher Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> of the <hi>Air.</hi> The <hi>Spirits</hi> of thoſe Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Tracts,</hi> may then be Frolicking in <hi>Viſible Forms,</hi> Celebrating Solemn <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> and kindling all the <hi>Meteors</hi> of the Upper <hi>Welkin,</hi> as Natural <hi>Fire-Works</hi> and <hi>Illuminations,</hi> not fit for Mortals to behold, leſt we ſhou'd learn too much, and grow as Wiſe as they. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it made me very Contemplative, to ſee a ſingle Solitary Cloud thus glide along the Air: And I cou'd have wiſh'd for Wings to purſue its Motions, becauſe the Appearance was not Common.</p>
                  <p>Thou that haſt meaſur'd the whole <hi>Frame</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and taken the True Dimenſions
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102963:177"/>of the <hi>World;</hi> that haſt penetrated into the Secrets of the <hi>Elements,</hi> and art always buſy'd in the moſt Sage and Solid Scrutinies; wilt ſmile at the Vanity of Common Mortals, ſuch as I, who when we are Unintelligible to our ſelves, yet preſume to comprehend the Ways of the <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> who is <hi>Perfect</hi> in <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for me, who have ſtudy'd in the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies,</hi> and read <hi>Ariſtotle, Avicen, Plotinus, Averroes,</hi> with other <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> I eſteem my ſelf ſtill but at the Bottom of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Cave, Converſing with Shadows, miſtaken in every Thing, but the <hi>Idea</hi> of thy <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Immenſe Wiſdom,</hi> which is Imprinted on my <hi>Soul,</hi> as thoſe which the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> call <hi>Firſt Principles,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>Self-Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſign'd to have ſaid more to thee; but a ſudden Indiſpoſition and Extreme Faintneſs, has taken away my Spirits. My Limbs trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, my Head is giddy, my Heart fails me. In a Word, I ſeem like one between a <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> and a <hi>Ghoſt.</hi>

                  <p>THY Sur-Name argues thee a <hi>Favourite</hi> at the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> And for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I know, thou art accuſtom'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Infinite Submiſſions and Flatteries. But I muſt be as blunt with thee, as I was with the New <hi>Mufti,</hi> when I Congratulated his <hi>Acceſſion</hi> to the <hi>Chief Patriarchate.</hi> I told that <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulman Prelates,</hi> that I had no Encouragement to welcome him to a <hi>Dignity,</hi> which though in it ſelf Sacred and Inviolable, yet cou'd not ſecure him from the Perſecutions of <hi>Popular</hi> Envy, any more than it did his <hi>Predeceſſor.</hi> And the ſame I muſt ſay to thee.</p>

Some Years ago, he forbad me to write any more to him. What his Reaſon was, I know not, neither did I ever enquire. However, I obey'd his Injunction; being Indifferent to whom I ſend my Intelligence, provided I do the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> any Service: For, to that End am I plac'd here.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Illuſtrious Baſſa,</hi> I ſhall now acquaint thee with Two the moſt Principal Points of News ſtirring in <hi>Europe.</hi> One is, the <hi>Election</hi> of <hi>Leopoldus Ignatius Joſephus, King</hi> of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to the <hi>German Empire.</hi> They have been canvaſing this Buſineſs Eleven <hi>Moons.</hi> And at laſt the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Faction carried it. This was done on the 8th. of the 7th. <hi>Moon.</hi> And he was ſolemnly <hi>Crown'd</hi> on the 22d. of the ſame. This has height'ned the Quarrel between the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the <hi>Prince Palatine.</hi> The Latter was ſo far tranſported with Paſſion at the <hi>Diet</hi> of <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> that he threw a <hi>Standiſh</hi> of <hi>Ink</hi> at the <hi>Bavarian Embaſſador:</hi> Which is reſented as an Unpardonable Affront. And the <hi>Duke</hi> is marching with an Army to revenge it, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Satisfaction. The <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Mentz</hi> has deny'd him Paſſage through his <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality.</hi> And they are all like to be embroil'd in a <hi>Civil War</hi> about it. This is no bad News for the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, that which makes yet a greater Noiſe, is the Death of <hi>Oliver,</hi> the <hi>Protector</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Commonwealth;</hi> who whilſt Living, was the Terror of all <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> and ſuch as regard Signs, ſay, This was preſag'd Three <hi>Moons</hi> ago, when a Great <hi>Whale,</hi> Nine Times as long as a tall Man, was taken in a River of <hi>England,</hi> near the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> City Forty Miles from the Sea. I know not whether theſe Kind of Obſervations are worthy of Credit. Yet, it ſeems, the <hi>Annals</hi> of that <hi>Nation</hi> take Notice, That the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:102963:179"/>Appearance of a <hi>Whale</hi> ſo far within Land, has always Prognoſticated ſome Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Change.</hi> Perhaps, the Fate of <hi>Illuſtrious Perſonages,</hi> affects <hi>Nature</hi> with a more than ordinary Paſſion, puts the <hi>Elements</hi> into a Diſorder, and Inſpires the <hi>Brutes</hi> with <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are aſſur'd, that on the Day of this <hi>Prince</hi>'s Death, and at the very Hour of his Departure, there was ſo Violent a Tempeſt of Wind, Rain, Hail, Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as had never been known by any Man then alive in that <hi>Nation.</hi> Which ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted to his Diſhonour, as if he were a <hi>Magician,</hi> or at leaſt a very Wicked Man: And that this <hi>Hurricane</hi> was rais'd by the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> who tranſported his <hi>Soul</hi> to <hi>Hell.</hi> Whilſt others affirm'd this Mix'd <hi>Storm,</hi> to be only the <hi>Sighs</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Mournful Paſſions</hi> of the <hi>Guardian Spirits</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for the Loſs of ſo Great and Fortunate a <hi>Hero:</hi> And that the very <hi>Inanimate Beings</hi> Condol'd his <hi>Death.</hi> As for me, I look on all theſe Things as pure <hi>Accidents,</hi> the Effects of <hi>Chance.</hi> I have an Equal Opinion of another Circumſtance, much obſerv'd both by his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Friends; That he died on the ſame Day, whereon he had formerly gain'd ſome Notable Victories. The <hi>One</hi> deſcanting on this to his Reproach, the <hi>Other</hi> drawing from it Arguments of Honour. 'Tis difficult to ſay any Thing of him, without appearing Partial. He had Great <hi>Vertues,</hi> and no Leſs <hi>Vices.</hi> He was a Valiant <hi>General,</hi> and wiſe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:102963:179"/>
                     <hi>Stateſman:</hi> Yet a <hi>Traytor</hi> to his <hi>Sovereign.</hi> As for <hi>Religion,</hi> though he profeſs'd himſelf a Zealot, yet 'tis thought, he was as Indifferent as other <hi>Princes;</hi> who for Reaſons of <hi>State,</hi> and to pleaſe their <hi>People,</hi> make a Shew of Piety, but in their Hearts Adore no other <hi>Gods</hi> but <hi>Fortune</hi> and <hi>Victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was eſteem'd one of the Greateſt <hi>Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> of this <hi>Age;</hi> and none cou'd match him but <hi>Mazarini.</hi> Yet I cannot but ſmile when I call to Mind, how both theſe Eminent <hi>Stateſmen</hi> were cheated this Year, by Two or Three <hi>Fugitives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A certain <hi>French Captain</hi> nam'd <hi>Gentilot,</hi> that had ſerv'd under the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> in the <hi>Wars,</hi> and on that Account had often paſs'd through the <hi>Sea-Towns</hi> in <hi>Flanders;</hi> obſerv'd a Weakneſs in one Part of the Walls of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> by which the <hi>Town</hi> mighty eaſily be ſurpriz'd. At his Return to <hi>Paris,</hi> he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> with this; and gave him ſo great Encouragement, that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> reſolv'd to try ſome <hi>Stratagem</hi> in Order to gain that Important Place, without the Coſt and Hazards of a Formal Siege.</p>
                  <p>To this End, he commands <hi>Gentilot</hi> to ſeek out ſome Perſons fit to be engag'd in the <hi>Plot:</hi> Men of Reſolution, Conduct and Secrecy. This <hi>Captain</hi> therefore knowing Two or Three <hi>Fugitives</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> who were forc'd to fly out of <hi>Flanders</hi> to ſave their Lives, having committed Murders, and other Crimes againſt the <hi>Spaniſh Government;</hi> breaks the Buſineſs to them, promiſing Mountains of <hi>Gold,</hi> if they wou'd aſſiſt in carrying it on.</p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:102963:180"/>
                  <p>They ſeem'd to embrace his Propoſals with Abundance of Readineſs, and were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s <hi>Cabinet.</hi> Where that <hi>Miniſter</hi> being ſatisfy'd in their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, and the Offers they made to ſerve him in this Affair; ſeconded the Promiſes which <hi>Gentilot</hi> had made 'em, with many Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Encouragements. In a Word, they conſulted together frequently; were late eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Night in the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Lodgings: And at laſt, having adjuſted all the Neceſſary Meaſures that were to be taken; the <hi>Fugitives</hi> were diſpatch'd away into <hi>England,</hi> with Letters from <hi>Mazarini</hi> to <hi>Oliver,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector.</hi> Wherein he acquainted him with the Deſign, requiring the Aſſiſtance of ſome <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Ships to tranſport Men into the <hi>Haven</hi> of <hi>Oſtend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Agents</hi> went accordingly, but with a Reſolution to put a Trick both on the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> and the <hi>Protector;</hi> and by doing their <hi>Country</hi> ſo Conſiderable a Service as the ſaving this <hi>Town,</hi> to merit a Repeal of the <hi>Sentence</hi> pronounc'd againſt 'em, that ſo they might return Home in Peace, and enjoy their Eſtates and Native Liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oliver</hi> receiv'd 'em very kindly, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd the Motion with ſome Warmth. But upon Second Thoughts, try'd to out-bribe <hi>Mazarini,</hi> and hire theſe Perſons for himſelf. <hi>Oſtend</hi> was too ſweet-a Bait in his Eye, to let it ſo tamely fall into the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> for Want of a few larger Promiſes, and Offers of Gold. Wherefore he ply'd theſe <hi>Agents</hi>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:102963:180"/>briskly with all the Effectual <hi>Oratory</hi> he could, to win 'em over to his own Separate Intereſt; engaging to beſtow Great <hi>Preferments</hi> on 'em in <hi>England,</hi> with Two Hundred Thouſand <hi>Sequins,</hi> as ſoon as the Buſineſs was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
                  <p>The Three <hi>Flemings</hi> deſired no better Sport, than thus to cajole Two the Ableſt <hi>Stateſmen</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> They poſſeſſed <hi>Oliver</hi> with an Entire Belief of their <hi>Zeal</hi> and Fidelity in his Service: And it was agree'd on between 'em, To hold <hi>Mazarini</hi> in Play, and that <hi>Oliver</hi> ſhould ſend him an Anſwer, refuſing to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in an <hi>Intrigue</hi> which ſeemed to carry ſo little Probability of Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>England</hi> theſe <hi>Agents</hi> paſſed over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Zealand.</hi> It having been ſo concluded before they parted from <hi>Cardinal Mazarini;</hi> that ſo they might there gain more Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and lay all the Neceſſary Trains to bring this <hi>Intrigue</hi> to the deſired Iſſue. But, Inſtead of doing either the <hi>Protector</hi> or <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Mazarini</hi> this Service, they went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and revealed the whole Secret to the <hi>Governor</hi> of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He having duly examined all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and being ſatisfied in the Truth of their Relations, and in their Loyalty to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> commanded them to proceed in deluding both the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as long as they could, with fair Hopes of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing their Aims. Whilſt he took Care to ſecure <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Flanders,</hi> from all Attempts of this Nature.</p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:102963:181"/>
                  <p>In fine, the <hi>Protector</hi> falling off again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frighted by <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi>'s Threats, who had diſcover'd his Under-Hand Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; theſe <hi>Agents</hi> applied themſelves cloſe to the <hi>French,</hi> who were now made ſo much more Eager, by <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Deſign to Interlope 'em. They ſpun out the <hi>Intrigue</hi> ſeveral <hi>Moons,</hi> brought the <hi>French King</hi> to ſign <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> and to paſs his Word for the Payment of near a Million of <hi>Gold;</hi> cajol'd his <hi>General</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and at one Time made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, 'Twas his Intereſt to lie ſtill for Six VVeeks together, when all the VVorld ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he would purſue his <hi>Conqueſts</hi> in that <hi>Province.</hi> At another Time, cauſed him to march with ſo much Precipitation, when the VVays were Unpaſſable, that he was forced to leave moſt of his Cannon, and a Thouſand VVaggons plunged in the deep Roads, with the Loſs of Three Thouſand Men, who were either drown'd or ſtarv'd: And all this for the Sake of gaining <hi>Oſtend.</hi> VVhen after all, they were not only cheated of their Hopes in that Point, but moſt ſhamefully expoſed to the Deriſion and Contempt of all <hi>Europe.</hi> For <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> repoſed an Entire Confidence in the Fidelity of his <hi>Flemiſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</hi> So that whatſoever they propoſed, as an Expedient to compaſs the Deſign, was a Law.

                  <p>All this was carried on with ſo much Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice and Subtle Management, that when he entered the <hi>Haven</hi> with Ten Veſſels, he thought himſelf ſecure of the <hi>Place:</hi> Yet no ſooner Landed his Men to the Number of Fifteen Hundred, but they thund'red upon them ſuch Volleys of Great and Small Shot from the Walls, that Two Hundred of them fell immediately, as many threw down their Arms, and the <hi>Citizens</hi> making a Vigorous Sally, the Reſt were either Kill'd or taken Priſoners, he himſelf not eſcaping that Misfortune.</p>

                     <hi>Iſouf</hi> relates Strange Things of thoſe <hi>Dark Countries,</hi> and ſuch as ſeem almoſt to ſurpaſs Credit, were they not confirm'd by very Grave and Learned <hi>Writers.</hi> He ſays, that in ſome <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Norway,</hi> no Tree is to be ſeen, by Reaſon of the Violent Force of the Winds, which blow down all before 'em, carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way even the Roofs of Houſes, and ſcattering them at a great Diſtance.

                  <p>But when he deſcribes the Horrible <hi>Coldneſs</hi> of theſe <hi>Regions,</hi> the very <hi>Idea</hi> of it is enough to make one quake.

Yet, others are of Opinion, that <hi>Cold</hi> is only a <hi>Privation</hi> of <hi>Heat,</hi> a bare <hi>Paſſive</hi> Diſpoſition of the <hi>Elements;</hi> and therefore more Senſibly felt in thoſe <hi>Climates</hi> that are fartheſt from the Warm <hi>Influences</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe Beams give Life and Vigor to All Things.

                     <hi>To</hi> Zeidi Alamanzi, <hi>a</hi> Merchant <hi>in</hi> Venice.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Kaimacham</hi> has informed me, that thou art appointed to ſucceed <hi>Adonai</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> He has alſo acquainted me with other Matters relating to thy <hi>Charge.</hi> I am glad they have found out a <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Capable of that <hi>Important Truſt;</hi> and that we ſhall not always ſtand in Need of <hi>Jews</hi> to ſerve the <hi>Grand Signior, Emperor</hi> of the <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Tho' ſome of that <hi>Nation</hi> are very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and Loyal; yet 'tis better to be without 'em.</p>
                  <p>Thou and I, are Strangers to each other: But 'tis Neceſſary for us to be ſpeedily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and hold a Mutual Intimacy by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that ſo we may ſerve our <hi>Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> without Interfering or Claſhing in our Intelligence. I have been here theſe Twenty Years, and made no Falſe Steps in my <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi>'s Buſineſs, whatever I have done in my own: Yet have encounter'd a Thouſand Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Perils; ſuffered Impriſonment many <hi>Moons</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> for my Fidelity; whilſt my Enemies at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted me as a <hi>Traytor</hi> and an <hi>Infidel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis Impoſſible to avoid theſe Croſſes, in the Courſe of Humane Life. They are as
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:102963:185"/>Natural as the Wind or the Rain. All that we can do is, by a prudent and dextrous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Contingences, to wind our ſelves out of Trouble as well as we can. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, rather to be our Own Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, than betray the leaſt Secret committed to us.</p>
                  <p>I queſtion not, but thou haſt had the ſame Inſtructions given thee by the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Happy Port.</hi> What I ſay, is only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm thee in thy Fidelity and Care. Write to me with the ſame Frankneſs, and let No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing make thee reſerved to thy <hi>Fellow-Slave.</hi> We are both <hi>Followers</hi> of the <hi>Prophet:</hi> We Worſhip <hi>One God</hi> after the ſame Manner, and Equally reverence the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> We ſerve <hi>One Maſter;</hi> and tho' in different <hi>Stations,</hi> yet let our Affections and Intereſts be United as Friends. Let no little narrow Paſſions or Emulations, corrupt our Integrity; or teach us to un-Man our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>I know not thy <hi>Original,</hi> whether thou art of <hi>Mahometan</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Parents. 'Twould be very Obliging to ſend me a ſhort <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of thy <hi>Life,</hi> and how thou learned'ſt the <hi>Italian Tongue:</hi> For without that, I judge they would not have ſent thee into that <hi>Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for me, I'm an <hi>Arabian</hi> by <hi>Birth,</hi> brought up in the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> from thence ſent to Sea; there taken <hi>Captive</hi> by the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> ſold in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where I underwent a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Servitude, yet at length gained my Freedom: and having paſſed through Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:102963:185"/>Fortunes, at laſt was ſent hither, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Secret <hi>Counſels</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of this <hi>Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now grow Old, having ſeen near Fifty Years. Yet tho' the Strength of my <hi>Body</hi> fails, I feel not the leaſt Decay in my Zeal for the <hi>Muſſulman Faith,</hi> or my <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. I'm ſtill <hi>Mahmut,</hi> the <hi>Loyal Slave</hi> of the <hi>Port;</hi> and thy Friend; ſo long as thou art ſo to thy ſelf.</p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimacham.</head>
                  <p>IT rejoyces me to hear, that <hi>Adonai</hi>'s <hi>Place</hi> is ſupplied by a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> in whom the <hi>Sublime Port</hi> may put more Confidence, than in any of <hi>Jewiſh Race.</hi> 'Twill be an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the <hi>True Faithful,</hi> and a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of good Import. For, no <hi>Nation</hi> love to ſee their <hi>Prince</hi> beſtow <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Truſt</hi> on <hi>Strangers,</hi> when his own <hi>People</hi> are as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Employment</hi> as they. 'Tis Generally taken as an Affront and Contempt of their Abilities or their Vertue, and has often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Ill Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>I deny not; but there are many Honeſt and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:102963:186"/>Wiſe Men among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Perſons of Merit and Honour, from whom the <hi>Sultan</hi> receives no ſmall Services. But, this ought not to diminiſh the Reputation of thoſe who are of the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> with their <hi>Sovereign.</hi> Doubtleſs, <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Turky</hi> are not barren of Good <hi>Soldiers,</hi> Prudent <hi>Stateſmen,</hi> and Dextrous <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know not the Character of <hi>Zeidi Alaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi,</hi> whether he be a Natural born <hi>Turk,</hi> a <hi>Tributary</hi> Son of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or a Voluntary <hi>Renegado.</hi> However, the Choice that is made of him, convinces me, that the Unerring <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> eſteem him a Man fit for the Buſineſs committed to his Charge.</p>
                  <p>He ought to be perfectly skill'd in <hi>Italian,</hi> or at leaſt in ſome other <hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarenes:</hi> That ſo he may paſs the better unſuſpected among the People where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, who are more Jealous of Strangers, than any other <hi>Nation</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> 'Tis a Crime thought worthy of Impriſonment, for a <hi>Venetian</hi> to converſe with a <hi>Foreigner</hi> too frequently, and in Private: For they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid leſt by that Means, a dangerous Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence ſhould be eſtabliſhed betwixt ſome Ill-affected Subjects of that <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and its Enemies: Whereby their Secrets may be betray'd, and Meaſures taken to ruine 'em.</p>
                  <p>For this Reaſon alſo, they have forbid <hi>Falſe Hair</hi> or <hi>Perrukes</hi> to be worn by any in their <hi>Dominions,</hi> leſt this might ſerve as a Diſguize for Villains and Traytors. Yet No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:102963:186"/>more common in <hi>France</hi> and other Countries of <hi>Europe,</hi> than for Men to wear on their Heads, Ornaments of Womens Hair, inſtead of their own.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Religion,</hi> I believe, they will not much trouble him, being no <hi>Zealots</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And provided he does but profeſs himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Catholick,</hi> they'll make no farther Inquiſition.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> in General, are much like the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> in their Humour. Men of grave Aſpects, and Carriage, and much more compos'd in both than the <hi>French,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Ridiculous through the Levity of their Diſcourſe and Actions. The Former abound in Sage Precepts of Morality, and Politick Aphoriſms, which ſerve as a Rule whereby to ſquare the Courſe of their Lives: The Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only affect ſome flaſhy Improvements of Wit and Converſation, ſtudying rather how to pleaſe Women, than Men; coveting to be perfect in External Accompliſhments, and the Graces of the Body, whilſt they ſlight the more valuable Endowments of the Mind. In a Word, they are mere <hi>Apes,</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks.</hi> On the Contrary, the <hi>Italians</hi> are Men of an Awful and Majeſtick Behaviour, ſolid Judgment, and deep Reach. If you ſee them ſmile, you ſhall ſeldom or never hear 'em laugh: Whereas, the Motion of a Feather will ſet the <hi>French</hi> a-Braying like <hi>Aſſes.</hi> Theſe will contract a Warm Friendſhip with any Man at firſt Interview, heighten it with a Thouſand Compliments, make him their
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:102963:187"/>
                     <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> and unboſom all their <hi>Secrets.</hi> Yet a <hi>Second</hi> Encounter ſhall extinguiſh this Paſſion, and a <hi>Third</hi> ſhall revive it again. Whereas, thoſe are cautious and flow in the choice of their Friends; and when once that Knot is diſſolv'd, 'tis never to be faſten'd there again. They are Irreconcilable in their Hatred and Revenge.</p>
                  <p>But, there are Men to be excepted in Both <hi>Nations,</hi> who fall not under theſe General Characters. <hi>France</hi> affords many Wiſe, and Learned Perſons; and <hi>Italy,</hi> not a few Fools and Ideots. Vertues and Vices are ſtrangely mix'd in all People. War, Commerce and Travel, with other Humane Occurrences, alter Men's Natural Diſpoſitions, and give the Lye to the Exacteſt Obſervations that can be made. Beſides, Time changes all Things: And the Qualities which this Age remarks in the <hi>Italians,</hi> may in the next be transferr'd to the <hi>French.</hi> For, there is no Conſtancy in any Thing under the <hi>Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zeidi</hi> will find great Examples of Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, among the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in the neceſſary Expences of their Perſons and Families; Yet Abundance of Magnificence in whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the <hi>Publick,</hi> which the <hi>Subjects</hi> of that <hi>Commonwealth</hi> ſerve with open Purſes, and free Hearts.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, they are not ſo Remarkable for their Temperance, as ſome other Parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> Libertiniſm and Voluptuouſneſs, reign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controul'd in <hi>Venice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Women</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> are there almoſt as Common, as the <hi>Elements.</hi>
                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:102963:187"/>Yet, 'tis obſerv'd, that Strangers generally debauch more with Both, than the Natives. <hi>God</hi> preſerve <hi>Zeidi</hi> from their Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>If it be his Fortune, or Duty to viſit <hi>Padua,</hi> he ought not to make too long an Abode in that Neſt of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> leſt they firſt Anatomize his <hi>Soul,</hi> and diſcover the <hi>Secrets</hi> of his <hi>Commiſſion;</hi> and then turn his Body to a <hi>Skeleton,</hi> as they once ſerv'd a <hi>Moor,</hi> whom they diſſected Alive, to make Experiment, perhaps, whether a <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s Blood Circulated the ſame Way as a <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe <hi>Italian Phyſicians,</hi> are very Cruel; and think it no Sin to try Poiſons, and other Fatal Tricks on the <hi>Poor,</hi> that ſo they may be the better able to keep the <hi>Rich</hi> on the Rack at their Pleaſure, and make their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket on 'em.</p>
                  <p>I know not <hi>Zeidi</hi>'s appointed <hi>Station,</hi> or what <hi>Cities</hi> he is to ſee: But, where-ever he goes, 'twill be Neceſſary for him to uſe Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Caution; for the <hi>Italians</hi> are the cloſeſt, ſlyeſt and moſt Judicious People in the World.</p>
                  <p>But, I forget that he is choſen by the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> for this <hi>Employment,</hi> to whom the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of all <hi>Nations</hi> are known, and who penetrate into the moſt Interiour Receſſes of Men's Spirits.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, I lay my Hand upon my Mouth in profound Submiſſion, and acquieſce to my <hi>Superiors.</hi> Still praying, That the <hi>Grand
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:102963:188"/>Signior</hi> may have Faithful and Wiſe <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> at <hi>Home,</hi> and no Novices for his <hi>Agents Abroad.</hi>

                  <p>THere is a <hi>Street</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> which they call the <hi>Street</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi> The Reaſon of this Name is ſaid to be, becauſe at one End of it, there formerly ſtood an Old Houſe, poſſeſs'd by <hi>Devils,</hi> who were ſo troubleſome, that as the <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> affirm, an <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> was paſs'd, to remove all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants out of their Houſes in that <hi>Street,</hi> and ſhut up the Entrance with a Wall. Since which, theſe <hi>Daemons</hi> were expell'd by the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> who built a <hi>Monaſtery</hi> in the Place. If this Story be true, it redounds much to the Reputation of that <hi>Order,</hi> and of all you <hi>Monaſticks</hi> in General, who by your <hi>Exerciſons</hi> are able to ſubdue the <hi>Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit.</hi> But I have heard ſo many ſilly Tales of Houſes being haunted by <hi>Ghoſts</hi> and <hi>Hobgoblins,</hi> that I know not how to give Credit to this,</p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:102963:188"/>
                  <p>Beſides, when I conſider the Nature of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal Beings,</hi> it ſeems Rediculous to think, that they can take Delight to play the <hi>Antiques,</hi> to frighten poor Mortals: Or confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to an Old Ruin'd <hi>Caſtle</hi> (for ſuch was this Houſe) for the Sake of a Little Sport; When according to the Ancient <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> every <hi>Incorporeal Being</hi> is far more Excellent than the moſt <hi>Perfect Body,</hi> and can be <hi>Every Where:</hi> Neither are they at any Time <hi>Locally</hi> Preſent in <hi>Bodies,</hi> but only by a Propenſion or Habit are inclin'd to them: And this they mean of <hi>Living Bodies.</hi> What <hi>Charm</hi> then can there be in an Old Rotten <hi>Fabrick</hi> of <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Wood,</hi> to allure and detain <hi>Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Subſtances?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, the Nature of theſe <hi>Separate Eſſences,</hi> is very Remote from all <hi>Compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Beings.</hi> I have been often at a Loſs, in Contemplating the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man. Sometimes it ſeems no otherwiſe diſtinguiſh'd from the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Brutes,</hi> than by being United to a <hi>Body</hi> of Different <hi>Organs;</hi> Which cauſes us to ſhew more Evident Tokens of <hi>Reaſon</hi> than they, in the <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> and in our <hi>Actions.</hi> Yet when I conſider more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively the <hi>Operations</hi> of our <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> I cannot but conclude, There is a vaſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between <hi>our Souls,</hi> and <hi>thoſe</hi> of the <hi>Beaſts.</hi> I have with Pleaſure obſerv'd the Excellency of <hi>Humane Intellect</hi> in <hi>Madmen</hi> and <hi>Dreamers;</hi> who being <hi>come to themſelves,</hi> (as we uſually ſay) relate many Things of which they were before Ignorant, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:102963:189"/>Things ſurpaſſing their Former Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>
                  <p>It appears therefore more Rational to me, That the <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>Every-Where</hi> and <hi>No-Where,</hi> as the <hi>Ancients</hi> ſay; Than that it is ſhut up and Impriſon'd in the <hi>Body,</hi> as a <hi>Wild Beaſt</hi> in his <hi>Den,</hi> or <hi>Liquor</hi> in a <hi>Glaſs.</hi> However, by an Ineffable Production of it ſelf, it is Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in <hi>Every Part</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> as the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> is diffus'd through the <hi>Air,</hi> and can as ſoon withdraw it ſelf, as that <hi>Light</hi> when interrupted by a <hi>Cloud.</hi> In a Word, I conceive the Soul to be a very <hi>Free Agent,</hi> and that it is <hi>here,</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> and <hi>every where.</hi> It United it ſelf to the <hi>Body</hi> by its own Choice, and can retire again from it at Pleaſure.</p>

                  <p>THere has not a Year eſcap'd, ſince my Arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein I did not ſend to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Ever Happy and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted <hi>Port,</hi> conſtant Intelligence of Battles, Sieges, Storming of Towns, and ſuch other Occurrences of <hi>War,</hi> as happen'd between the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> But now I believe, my Future <hi>Diſpatches</hi> muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other Matters. For, in all Appearance, this <hi>War</hi> which has laſted Four and Twenty Years, is in a fair Way to be ended. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> grows weary of his Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Loſſes in <hi>Italy, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Catalonia:</hi> And he of <hi>France,</hi> ſeems glutted with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Victories and Conqueſts. In a Word, theſe Two Potent <hi>Monarchs</hi> laying aſide their Quarrels, are making diligent Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this Year for a <hi>Campagne</hi> of Friendſhip and Love.</p>
                  <p>They are both in <hi>Arms,</hi> yet commit no Acts of <hi>Hoſtility.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> on the Part of this <hi>Crown,</hi> and <hi>Dom Louis d' Aro de Guſman, Firſt Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> are gone to meet each other on the <hi>Frontiers</hi> of both <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> as <hi>Plenipotentiaries</hi> for their Reſpective <hi>Maſters,</hi> to concert the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:102963:190"/>of a Laſting <hi>Peace,</hi> and treat of a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> between the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All <hi>Europe</hi> is amaz'd at this ſurprizing Change. And the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who border on each other, can hardly believe their own Senſes, whilſt they find a Mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce reſtor'd between their. <hi>Frontier Towns</hi> and <hi>Villages,</hi> which had been Interrupted, ever ſince the Year 1635. about Sixteen <hi>Moons</hi> before I came to this City.</p>
                  <p>But, though they are thus diſpoſed to <hi>Peace</hi> here in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> the <hi>Northern Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> are puſhing the <hi>War</hi> forward in <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> with all Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Vigour and Animoſity. The coming over of the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Intereſt, has made a great Alteration in their Affairs. For, whereas <hi>Fortune</hi> ſeem'd before in all Things to favour the <hi>Suedes;</hi> now they loſe Ground, and find their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts Unſucceſsful. Four Thouſand of their Men fell before the Walls of <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> in Three Nights and Two Days: Which caus'd <hi>King Guſtavus</hi> to raiſe the Siege. Whilſt the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> retook <hi>Fredericks-Ode,</hi> and thereby reſtor'd to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmark,</hi> the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Holſtein, Jutland</hi> and <hi>Dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> alſo have had a Combat with the <hi>Suedes</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> and ſunk Fourteen of their beſt Ships: Beſides what they burnt and took.</p>

                  <p>THE Character, which the Great and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious <hi>Abdel Melec Muli Omar, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident</hi> of <hi>Preſidents, Grace</hi> and <hi>Ornament</hi> of <hi>Ancient Learning, Oracle</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer</hi> of <hi>Obſolete Truth;</hi> has given me of thy Profound Wiſdom and Science, fills me with Reverence and Sacred Love. I am ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with Wonder and Joy to hear, That in this Age, wherein the <hi>Muſſulman Theology</hi> has ſuffered ſo many Innovations, there yet ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives a Man who dares, and is able to aſſert
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:102963:191"/>againſt all Oppoſers, not only the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> Truth, brought down from <hi>Heaven</hi> by the Hand of <hi>Gabriel;</hi> but alſo the Real and Indubitable <hi>Sayings, Sermons, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels,</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> whilſt he was on <hi>Earth</hi> converſing with <hi>Mortals,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Tranſmigration</hi> to the <hi>Gardens</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Repoſe</hi> and <hi>Solitude.</hi> Thou art the <hi>Enoch,</hi> the <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus</hi> of the <hi>Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſeen many <hi>Copies</hi> of the <hi>Zunè,</hi> or the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Doctrine;</hi> each pretending to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the whole <hi>Syſtem</hi> of that <hi>Divine Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which dropt from the Lips of our <hi>Incomparable</hi> and moſt <hi>Holy Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> and were Atteſted by his <hi>Wife,</hi> the Holy <hi>Ageſha, Mother</hi> of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> and by his <hi>Ten Diſciples.</hi> Yet all theſe various <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts</hi> differ, both in their Sence and Manner of Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>I have peruſed the <hi>Books</hi> Entituled <hi>Dahif,</hi> or <hi>Imperfect;</hi> which contain the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of his other <hi>Wives;</hi> and the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> called <hi>Maucof,</hi> or <hi>Fragments:</hi> Being only a <hi>Collection</hi> of ſome <hi>Select Sentences, Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms</hi> and <hi>Parables</hi> of the <hi>Sent</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> But theſe have no other Authority to back 'em, ſave the Credit of ſome <hi>Learned Scribes,</hi> who were not familiar with the <hi>Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,</hi> only living in his Time, and taking Things on Report.</p>
                  <p>In fine, I have met with ſeveral <hi>Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the <hi>Zaquini,</hi> or Pretended <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Abu Becre, Omar,</hi> and <hi>Othman:</hi> But theſe I eſteem as Spurious, Corrupted, and full of Errors.</p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:102963:191"/>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay? The Zeal of <hi>Omar Ebn Abdi'l-Aziz,</hi> the Ninth <hi>Caliph</hi> of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Merwan,</hi> is not unknown to me. I am no Stranger to his ſingular Piety, not to be matched among <hi>Crowned</hi> Heads: For, of him it is Recorded, That as he deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the <hi>Throne</hi> at the Time of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration,</hi> he gave the Robe from his Back, as an Alms to a Poor Man; And, That during his whole <hi>Reign,</hi> he ſpent but Two <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> a-Day on himſelf. And ſo great was his Reſignation to <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> (an Admirable Vertue in a <hi>Sovereign Emperour</hi>) that when he was on his Bed in his laſt Sickneſs, and was counſelled to take <hi>Phyſick,</hi> he anſwered, <hi>No; if I were ſure to heal my ſelf, only by reaching my Finger to my Ear, I would not. For, the Place to which I am going, is full of Health and Bliſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Caliph</hi> was a Miracle of Humility, and his Charity always kept him Poor. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlema Ebn Abdi'l Malec</hi> relates, That going to viſit <hi>Omar</hi> on his Death-Bed, he found him lying on a Couch of Palm-Leaves, with Three or Four Skins inſtead of a Pillow, his Garments on, and a foul Shirt underneath. Seeing this, <hi>Moſlema</hi> was grieved, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Siſter <hi>Phatema</hi> the <hi>Empreſs,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>How comes it to paſs, that the Great Lord, Commander of the Faithful, appears in ſo ſqualid a Condition?</hi> She replyed, <hi>As thou liveſt, he has given away all that he had, even to the very Bed that was under him, to the Poor, and only reſerved what thou ſeeſt, to
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:102963:192"/>cover his Nakedneſs.</hi> Then <hi>Moſlema</hi> could not refrain, but burſt forth into Tears, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God ſhew thee Mercy upon Mercy, thou Royal Saint: For, thou haſt pierced our Hearts with the Fear of his Divine Majeſty.</hi> This <hi>Caliph</hi> was numbred among the <hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He it was, that perceiving the Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Diſputes of the <hi>Muſſulman's,</hi> the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Confuſion in the Various <hi>Copies</hi> of the <hi>Zunè,</hi> or <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Doctrine;</hi> aſſembled a <hi>General Divan</hi> of <hi>Mollah's,</hi> and <hi>Learned Men</hi> at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> from all Parts of the <hi>Empire:</hi> Commanding that all the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> of the <hi>Zunè,</hi> which were extant, ſhould be brought in to this <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> on Pain of Death to him that ſhould detain one. This being done, he Commanded <hi>Six</hi> of them, to be choſen out of the <hi>Whole Number,</hi> by Vote; Men E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for Learning and Piety: And that theſe <hi>Six</hi> ſhould ſeverally collect, out of all the Multitude of <hi>Copies,</hi> each Man a <hi>Book,</hi> containing what he thought to be the moſt <hi>Genuine Diſcourſes</hi> of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> concerning this <hi>World,</hi> and that which is to come. When this was executed according to his Will, he commanded all the Old <hi>Books</hi> to be burn'd, in a Field near <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, after all the <hi>Religious</hi> Care of this <hi>Holy Caliph,</hi> to reſtore theſe <hi>Writings</hi> to their <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive</hi> Integrity, the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> ſoon fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to New Contentions, about the <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of theſe <hi>Correct Copies</hi> of the <hi>Zunè.</hi> From whence ſprang the <hi>Four Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Sects,</hi> on which, all the Innumerable,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:102963:192"/>leſſer and later Diviſions among <hi>True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> are founded.</p>
                  <p>I cannot therefore but inwardly rejoyce, and from my Heart highly applaud the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod taken by thoſe of your Renowned <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> to diſcern the <hi>True Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Sayings</hi> of the <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> from thoſe which are <hi>Suppoſititious,</hi> by comparing all the <hi>Books</hi> that are extant together, and reducing <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Regards, to the Standard of <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>Reaſon:</hi> For, it is Impious to believe, that the <hi>Divine Apoſtle</hi> would impoſe any Thing on our <hi>Faith,</hi> repugnant to the <hi>Sence</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> or the <hi>Expreſs Will</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> By the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras, Mahomet</hi> ſaid Nothing but what was Rational, and Evident to any Unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Mind. But, the Greateſt Part of theſe <hi>Sectaries,</hi> are beſotted. They form to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Falſe Notions of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Prophet,</hi> and think to merit <hi>Paradiſe</hi> by their Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                  <p>Reverend <hi>Alfaqui,</hi> I have much more to ſay to thee, and many Queſtions to ask; But, Time and the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Service, force me to conclude abruptly, wiſhing thee <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of <hi>Bliſs.</hi>
